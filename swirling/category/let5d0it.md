[#LET5D0IT](https://bsky.app/profile/let5d0it.bsky.social) is part of a "1000-day project to find the best singles since the Birth of Pop" - so every day between now and 20th May I'll be posting my choices for the best 50 singles between 1954 (birth of Rock & Roll) to 1976 (birth of Punk). 

I didn't decide to do this until quite late on so haven't had as much time as I'd like so there will unquestionably be ommisions and mistakes but... this is _my top 50_ as of the end of March 2024. They are in no particular order except I'll try and make my last 10 my _top 10_.
