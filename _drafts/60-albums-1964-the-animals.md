When I reached 50 in 2014 I did a [series of posts](/category/50-albums) listening to and jotting down my thoughts on an album of each year of my life. In May this year I reach 60 so it seemed like time to try to do that again. So, welcome to [60 albums](/category/60-albums) and I'm going to start close to home... although it was a long way from home until quite recently!

I always have had a slight soft spot for Newcastle's The Animals, like London's The Pretty Things, they felt a bit grubbier and less polished than The Stones, and therefore a little closer to the place they started. Having said that I owned a couple of second-hand albums - a compilation and a live album, both sadly went astray (ironically) in our move to the North East. Two albums seemed enough for me, particularly as they only really existed for a couple of years.

The band's first LP was released in late 1964, the first few months of my life. I started my 50 albums series with [The Rolling Stones debut album](/swirling/2014/01/02/50-albums-1964-the-rolling-stones-by-the-rolling-stones/) which was the album that was #1 the day I was born and declared that it _opened doors_ - **The Animals** (the album) I guess walks the same road as that one and opened those same doors - it calls back on the classic blues and rock and roll past that The Stones did but I think I like it more.

It opens with _The Story of Bo Diddley_ which is just Eric Burdon telling a yarn about Bo Diddley, and The Animals and the birth of rock and roll ~ _"we were playing the Club-a-Gogo in Newcastle, our hometown..."_. The track opens with Alan Price's doing the Bo Diddley riff on his organ (and that organ might be the main reason this is an album I love more than The Rolling Stones one).

It then hits most rock and roll touch points ~ Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, John Lee Hooker.
