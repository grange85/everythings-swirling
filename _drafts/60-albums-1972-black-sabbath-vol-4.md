When I listen to Sabbath albums I generally reach for Paranoid, or maybe Black Sabbath and Master of Reality and Vol4 rarely get a look-in, although both have tracks that I'd consider to be Sabbath at the top of their game but neither really tempts me in to often listen to it through. For Vol4 I'll blame Changes!

Sabbath first entered my life via a 7" single of Paranoid that I got at a jumble sale in around 1978, this was followed by a Greatest Hits album, a second-hand copy of Paranoid (the album) and, in about 1980 the unofficial "Live at Last" album that I loved. I however never saw them live, they were scheduled to play at the Heavy Metal Holocaust at Port Vale but were replaced by Ozzy (who had just released Blizzard of Ozz) - Ozzy was fantastic that day and at that point my alegience was set in stone. I never gave post-Ozzy Sabbath a look in.

I bought Vol4 around then, from a record sale somewhere, the price sticker reads 75p, and as well as Vol4, a sleeveless copy of Master of Reality was included. So, 75p for two fine albums.
