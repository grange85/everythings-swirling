When I listen to Sabbath albums I generally reach for Paranoid, or maybe Black Sabbath and Master of Reality and Vol4 rarely get a look-in, although both have tracks that I'd consider to be Sabbath at the top of their game but neither really tempts me in to often listen to it through. For Vol4 I'll blame Changes!
