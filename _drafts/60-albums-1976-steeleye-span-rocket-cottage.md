I love Steeleye Span, and I love Mike Batt, so I have always had a particular love for _All Around My Hat_ (even if the band don't particularly). Despite all that love I was unaware that Mike Batt had also produced the follow up Rocket Cottage.

Rocket Cottage wasn't a commercially successful record, Wikipedia suggests (without any supporting evidence) that "the sudden explosion of the British Punk scene saw audience tastes in the UK rapidly shift away from formerly popular genres like folk rock and progressive rock" - punk gets blamed for a lot but a look at the 1976 album charts would suggest that punk had very little effect - there wasn't a [single punk LP in the top 10 albums charts in 1976](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UK_top-ten_albums_in_1976), and the first single by a UK punk band was New Rose by The Damned released four months after Rocket Cottage - and it didn't chart either.

So, I suspect there were other reasons that Steeleye Span and/or folk-rock had drifted out of the UKs consciousness, maybe it was All Around My Hat's fault!? I don't think it can be the fault of the album (or its production) because...
