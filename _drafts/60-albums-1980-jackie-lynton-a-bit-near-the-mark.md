Jackie Lynton was, and I like to think still is, a bit of a local pub legend around the pubs of Surrey and South London. He's had a long, long career from early 60s pop, playing the Larry Parnes circuit in the early 60s, a weird rock/psych cover of [Teddy Bear's Picnic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxU2AKoKrok), and, a stint as the singer with Savoy Brown (recruited while he was woeking on a building site). He also was the person you hear [introducing Status Quo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfjygEXVOCg) at the beginning Status Quo's excellent [Quo+Live!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live!_(Status_Quo_album)). However, by the time we started seeing him in the early 80s he was back on the local pub circuit, playing gigs of rock and roll, dirty jokes and songs, and obscene poetry!

... and we saw him a lot, I have memories of us celebrating our 100th Jacko gig. It was fairly easy racking up those sort of numbers, he played most weekends (and probably most weekdays) and if we were at a loose end and Jacko was playing, we'd go see him. One of his regular haunts was The New Golden Lion in Fulham, just around the corner from Stamford Bridge - it was probably where we saw him most - he'd often do a whole week of gigs around Christmas and New Year and we'd often go to them all!

A Bit Near The Mark is a live album that was recorded at The Golden Lion in 1980, I don't think we were at this gig though.

My copy was bought at a gig, and is signed by the band, although weirdly Jack's signature is dedicated to someone who wasn't me!?

I must admit that I haven't listened to this album (or any of my other Jacko albums) for probably 30 years... for most of that time they lived in my parents garage with a lot of my past, a lot of which is still there. Now to give it a listen.
