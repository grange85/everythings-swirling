The thing about Sarah Records was that I was too tied up in Galaxie 500 (and Pale Saints and Teenage Fanclub and Yo La Tengo and Pixies and Throwing Muses) to find myself tied up in Sarah as well, it wasn't for any real reason that's just the way it happened. But of course, because of Ken (and Brian) and Harvey, it was hard not to have that scene rubbing off on me. I think most of the Sarah Records records I have might have been given to me by Ken, or bought becuase of that. I know I bought and loved Laurel by Brighter, and I think Ken gave me a few Field Mice records including Coastal.

But I listened to it a lot, and still dig it out regularly.

I saw quite a few of the bands back then, although never The Field Mice, but have seen more in recent years thanks mainly to Indietracks.
