title: '60 albums: 1965 - The Beatles - Help! (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)'
---
For 50 albums I made a lot of use of Spotify but thought this time I'd try, as much as possible, to include albums...

- that I already own on LP
- that Hazel owns on LP
- that I can pick up in our local charity shops for pennies
- that I can pick up on Discogs for pennies

The danger of this is of course that it will be a bit heavy on the white, male and guitar driven (although the second bullet-point above helps to level things out a little).

So, for 1965 we have some white lads with guitars... and an orchestra.

I must admit I have no idea how this American copy of The Beatles' Help! came into my collection, we had a _proper_ copy of the album as well so this rarely got a look in - it felt like (I suppose what it was) half a Beatles album and why listen to a half when you can listen to an album that has _It's Only Love_ and _Yesterday_ on it? Although... no _Dizzy Miss Lizzy_ so... swings and roundabouts!
