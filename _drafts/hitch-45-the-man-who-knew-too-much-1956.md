Every time I watch the remake of The Man Who Knew Too Much, I feel a bit sad that Hitch made it at all because it's not that great, and while the 1934 version might not be *great* either it is head and shoulders above this - we made sure by rewatching that and if anything I liked that version even more this time - although perhaps because of the disappointment of this one?

It is so clunky and lacks any of the charm of the previous film - the taxidermist chaos was good; the comedy meal was unbearable; the villains were good, but not Peter Lorre good!

And the finale in the embassy was a painful end - and can't even come close to the bonkers shoot-out at the end of the 1934 version.

To be honest I struggled to find anything to say, I didn't want this post to be a comparison, but it was hard to ignore that it was a remake, and a vastly inferior one at that.

I've given it a five, but even that seems generous
