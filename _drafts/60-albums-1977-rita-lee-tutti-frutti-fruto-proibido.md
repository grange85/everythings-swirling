OK, I'm breaking my rules for 1975 since I don't have a physical copy of this album but, for the following reasons I'm running with it:

{% ahfowimage "https://live.staticflickr.com/3212/2955633198_60d64b21f0.jpg" "Fruto Probido via jessicapessoadesativado on Flickr" "https://www.flickr.com/photos/jessicapessoa/2955633198/" %}

 - The only 1975 albums I already have on LP have either...
   - been blogged about before
   - are by artists that are turning up later in the series
 - I need to look beyond the the UK (10 out of the first 11 posts) and the US (the other one).

The other thing I need to look beyond is very much NOT represented here since this is very, very much a rock and roll album.

Adam was shared a long list of Brazilian music that I thought I should dip into. I did have two Brazilian acts in my 50 albums series, one of which featured Rita Lee, so I still haven't managed to broaden out as far as I should.

Rita was the original singer of rock band Os Mutantes whose [1968 self-titled record](/swirling/2014/01/10/50-albums-1968-os-mutantes-by-os-mutantes/) was in my [50 albums series](/category/50-albums) and while this album is a fun rock and roll album it doesn't really have the depth of that one.
