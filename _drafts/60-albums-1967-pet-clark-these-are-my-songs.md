I've always had a soft spot for Petula Clark, maybe because she was in a couple of my favourite films ([IKWIG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Know_Where_I%27m_Going!) and [The Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Card_(1952_film))), and [she's danced with Fred Astaire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6Wp4GiCGkw). Plus, [Downtown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SsuPw0tqCE) was apparently the first song I sang.

The front of [These Are My Songs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/These_Are_My_Songs) calls her Pet Clark, the back of the sleeve gives the album a more verbose title **This Is My Song, Don't Sleep in the Subway and other celebrations by Petula Clark** which highlights the two biggest hits on the album, but there's plenty more to love: 

The sleeve, and the typography on the front of it.

The hilariously rambling sleeve notes:
 - _"There are those who celebrate firecrakcers, estrangemnets, hirings, refunds, dentures, solstices, elections, launchings, the end of gastric acidity"_
 - _"Loosing her tinker tiny hands over her hips, waist, thighs in fitful caresses. Loosing an erotic psalm  through a bent black microphone. Celebrating love through thirty-two bars of verse, and changing verse into poetry, and poetry into honesty"_
 - _"The nerves, if any, wearing cosmetic smiles, disolving in genial hugs, suffocating under bi-cheek kisses"_

Petula's voice... plus there's not a dud on the album.

There are a few clips of Pet singing Don't Sleep in The Subway but sadly all are pretty low-res ... this might be the best
