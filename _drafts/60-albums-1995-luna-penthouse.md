In 1994, for want of anything better to do, I started a [fan website for "Galaxie 500 and related artists"](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/) and followed it shortly after with a mailing list for fans of the bands. Luna, of course, were one of those "related artists" and Penthouse was the first album released while the website and mailing list existed. It was also on the tour supporting Penthouse that I first met fans I knew until then only through the Internet.

Sadly, I've lost the mailing list archives from before 1999 (you can find some earlier posts that I also forwarded to [alt.music.galaxie-500]() but not far enough back), and the Wayback Machine only has captures back to 1997, so I don't have any evidence of how the album was received back then. However, in the 1995 end of year survey it only clocked up 16% of the vote and came in third of their three albums! It gradually crept and by 1998 it came top in the survey, and did in every subsequent survey until I stopped doing them a couple of years back.


I've obvioulsy listened to Penthouse a lot in the 29 years since its release so it seems a bit of a fraud listening to it for this series, but... my blog.
