1. Groucho Marx - Lydia The Tattooed Lady (from the 1939 film [At The Circus]())
2. Chico Marx - Beer Barrel Polka (also from the 1939 film _At The Circus_)

Two from the same film, and actually from the same sequence in the same film!

### Day 4 / Song #1 <br/> Groucho Marx - Lydia The Tattooed Lady (1939)
This is perfect Groucho and since it's Groucho it works almost as well without the moving pictures as it does with them.

### Day 4 / Song #2 <br/> Chico Marx - Beer Barrel Polka (1939)
I wasn't sure that I was going to pick Chico's "Roll Out The Barrel" because so much of Chico's performances are visual, not just his hands, but his eyes, his facial expressions, his movement on the seat, his interaction with his audience... but, after listening without looking, I can still sense all of that because his playing has so much energy and the dynamics and pacing give us most of that! It's still thrilling. But, watch it!

At The Circus may not be the Marx Brothers finest but it not only has these two songs but also has Eve Arden!
