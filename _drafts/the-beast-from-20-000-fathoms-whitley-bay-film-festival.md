title: The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms - Whitley Bay Film Festival
---
This evening I took another trip out to the Lighthouse to see The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms as part of the [Whitley Bay Film Festival](). Another well chosen film (and another Harryhausen masterpiece) after last years presentation of It Came From Beneath the Sea.

Tonight's screening was much better attended than last years which was nice to see. The intros and supporting material were overlong and rather dull, and the film didn't actually start until 45 minutes after the advertised time - and then ten minutes after it started the food orders that had been taken at the door, arrived and were distributed, which was a bit distracting - although thankfully that happened during the talky bit of the film.
