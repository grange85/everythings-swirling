Over Christmas in 1974 The Mermaid Theatre in Blackfriars presented "Treasure Island: A Musical Adventure", with Bernard Miles as Long John Silver, Willie Rushton as Squire Trelawney,and, probably significantly for me, Spike Milligan as Ben Gunn.

I was ten years old and had become quite a Spike fan in the previous years which mostly manifested itself by reading books of Goon Show scripts, and occasionally getting lucky enough to hear one on the radio. So, my dad took me to see Spike in Treasure Island, I can only assume that it was my Spike love explains why Helen and Anton weren't invited along.

I remember the show and the trip fairly well considering it's getting on for 50 years ago now, although having this cast album has helped with that. We also had the programme which I was hoping to find tucked into the sleeve but sadly not.
