Like, I suspect, most people, my introduction to Vashti Bunyan was at the beginning of the 2000s rather than the beginning of the 1970s when this album was made.

The album is more than an album, it's a story too, and one that's told in Vashti's lovely book _Wayward_. The story is of a two year long trek from London to the Outer Hebrides with a horse-drawn wagon, a dog, a guitar, and her then partner. The journey was mostly not as romantic as that sounds.

The album is beautiful... a Google search makes it clear that it is actually _impossible_ to describe the album (and/or Vashti's voice) without using the words "fragile" or "delicate" _(About 24,400 results for your search '"Vashti Bunyan" "fragile"')_ - I could try but I'm not a wordsmith and _fragile_ and _delicate_ it mostly is.

I didn't buy my physical copy until a couple of years ago, a nice 2019 reissue on clear vinyl and a lovely stiff gatefold sleeve but I was already very familiar with the record by then. After reading Wayward I felt the need to have a real copy. My copy sounds beautiful, I'd suggest more beautiful than the original 1970 release which sells for over Â£1000 whenever it turns up on Discogs.

Damon & Naomi did a [lovely cover of Winter is Blue](
