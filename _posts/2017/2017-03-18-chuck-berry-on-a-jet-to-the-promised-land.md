<p class="lead">I saw Chuck Berry twice in the late 80s, both times at the Hammy Odeon. I love that I can say that - they're memories I wouldn't do without.</p>
<p>Having said that they are memories that are muddled and murky, I don't remember what he played - I hope he played Promised Land, both times - let's just assume he did.</p>
<p>I do remember at one point a young man jumped on stage and started dancing energetically around and Chuck wandered over to him, mid-song and said something to him. The young man wandered off the stage&hellip; and returned with a bunch of pals and they all started dancing! I loved that despite his reputation Chuck clearly loved how his music made people feel.</p>
<p>Capital Radio, the morning after one of the gigs was gushing about the fact that Chuck had been contracted for a 60 minute set but had actually played 64 minutes! Suggesting that he was so lost in the show that he gave us four minutes of his time for nothing!</p>
<p>We were lucky. I'm glad.</p>
<p>Chuck kept coming over but I never got around to seeing him again.</p>
