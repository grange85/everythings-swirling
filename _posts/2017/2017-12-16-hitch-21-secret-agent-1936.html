<p class="lead">Argh! I was supposed to write these little updates directly after seeing the film&hellip; but it's been months since we sat down to watch Secret Agent and we can't move on until the posts have been written - and Hitch's true golden period is on the horizon!</p>
<p>I enjoyed Secret Agent, it deosn't have as much charm or wit as <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2017/08/05/hitch-20-the-39-steps/">The 39 Steps</a>, but it has a silly enjoyable yarn. Gielgud is fine, and while he doesn't have the fizz with Madeleine Carroll that Donat had, it still works well enough for me (I think Hazel disagrees).</p>
<p>And another fab train crash to finish the film - maybe better delivered than that in <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2017/03/09/hitch-17-number-seventeen-1932/">Number 17</a>, but nowhere near as much fun!</p>
