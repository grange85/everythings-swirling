<p class="lead">A couple of weekends back Hazel and I spent a weekend in Cardiff for the lovely Wales Goes Pop! festival - the whole thing was a joy, but here's a few particularly good bits &hellip;</p>
<h3>Deerful</h3>

<p>Lovely to see Emma again, she makes beautiful music, has a lovely voice, and does charming and funny between songs banter - there's nothing not to love about Deerful!</p>

<h3>The Gate</h3>
<p>The venue is a lovely former church beautifully converted into an arts centre. The main performance space was the former gallery of the church, with the original pews around three sides. Underneath was a cafe and the second stage. Given that we were to spend so much of the weekend here it was a treat.</p>

<h3>Milgi</h3>
<p>Milgi is a restaurant it's in this list because it was a stone's throw from the venue and it had lovely and imaginative vegetarian food served in a comfortable envinronment, by friendly people.</p>
<p>It was so good we went there three times!</p>
