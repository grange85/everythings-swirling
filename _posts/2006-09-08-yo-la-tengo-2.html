<p>Stuart and I went to see the fantastic <a href="http://www.yolatengo.com">Yo La Tengo</a> on Tuesday. Over the 16 or 17 years I've been seeing Yo La Tengo their live shows can best be desribed as unpredictable...<br/><br/>sometimes too "angry" as when they supported Stereolab at the Shepherd's Bush Empire and played 40 minutes of noisy guitar rock (I think the 40 minutes was maybe 2 or three songs!) and...<br/><br/>sometimes too gentle - the sweet songs are lovely but ocasionally there can be just too much - lat time I saw them (also at the Empire) it was probably half an hour before Ira even touched a guitar!</p>
<p>Tuesday night they got the balance spot on and never lingered too long on either side of the Yo La Tengo divide. The songs from the new album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000GUK0HM%26tag=aheadfullofwi-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000GUK0HM%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82" title="View product details at Amazon">I Am Not Afraid Of You And I Will Beat Your Ass</a> sounded good and the oldies sounded exceptional - particularly "Stockholm Syndrome" and an awesome "I Heard You Looking". They played a couple of Arthur Lee tunes in tribute and finished with a lovely take on Sandy Denny's "By The Time It Gets Dark".</p>
<p>I've <a href="http://blog.fullofwishes.co.uk/swirling/2006/06/29/i-heart-yo-la-tengo/">said it before</a> but I'll say it again - I (heart) Yo La Tengo</p></p>
