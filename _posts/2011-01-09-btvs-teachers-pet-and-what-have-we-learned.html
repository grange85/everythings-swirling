<p>The moral of Teacher's Pet was "do your homework" which, while rather admirable in its intention, is pretty lame by any standards. </p>
<p>As well as the clumsy primary moral I also learned...</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't take off your jacket if you've forgotten to put on a shirt... you'll look very silly in a club with a vest on!</li>
<li>If you're an extremely nice minor character in <em>Buffy</em> then you're either a demon or about to die at the hands (or pincers) of a demon.</li>
<li>When it's important to find a vampire in the Sunnydale sewer system it's actually very easy to do.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Here's a ridiculously cute screencap to cover for the lack of anything else of interest in this blog post...<br />
