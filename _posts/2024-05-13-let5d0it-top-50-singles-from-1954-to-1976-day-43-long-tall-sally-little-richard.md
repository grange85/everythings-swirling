_Long Tall Sally - Little Richard (1956)_  
There was always (early) rock and roll around me, but after Glam Rock had filled my life in the mid-70s Little Richard made so much more sense. More than Elvis, and more than Chuck, Little Richard was the epitomy of rock and roll, maybe his 70s glam/pomp revival (and how _glam_ he was during that) made it seem that way to me.
