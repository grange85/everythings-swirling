### Day 19 / Song #1<br/>Marlene Dietrich - The Boys in The Backroom  (from [Destry Rides Again (1939)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destry_Rides_Again))
Oddly the film version of the song isn't on YouTube (or at least I can't find it) and this is another song that we recoreded to cassette of the telly so the version I'm voting for is very much the one from the film with the clattering bar room noises, and the snips of dialogue - you need to _hear_ Frenchy literally kicking arse! This version is tame by comparison...

### Day 19 / Song #2<br/>Laurel & Hardy - Trail of The Lonesome Pine (from [Way Out West (1937)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Way_Out_West_(1937_film))) 
... of course the version of this that was a hit in the UK in the mid-70s was directly lifted from _Way Out West_ and so has all the dialogue and sounds needed to make it perfect. Needs nothing more.
