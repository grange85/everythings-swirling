1981 was peak-NWOBHM and while I could probably have posted about great heavy metal albums from 1980 to 1982 or '83 I thought I'd roll the best of them into a single post and 1981 had three of the very best.

## Saxon - Denim & Leather
OK, if pushed I'd probably pick 1980's _Wheels of Steel_ as my favourite Saxon album, but it's a pretty close run thing and this album has some absolute gems - Princess of the Night, Never Surrender, And The Band Played On are close to perfect. I saw Saxon live a couple of times in 1981, most memorably at The Rainbow in Finsbury Park in December 1981, and then a few more times up until about 1983 or so... and then a 39 year gap until December 2022 at The City Hall in Newcastle - they still rock.

The opener, Princess of the Night is about a steam train, I've always loved the slight nerdiness of that, just imagining Biff and the lads at the end of York station with their notebooks.

## Girlschool - Hit and Run
Girlschool's second album is an absolute blinder. Girlschool then had three great voices sharing the songs, Kim, Enid and Kelly all doing their turn - these days, with Kelly sadly no longer with us, and Enid sadly no longer in the band, Kim does all the singing. But the songs I like best from the past always seemed to have Enid singing, [Yeah, right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykF6EEFS9Hw). I saw Girlschool probably half a dozen times from 1981 to 1983 or so... and then a 39 year gap until November 2021 at Trillians in Newcastle (and twice since) - they still rock.

## Raven - Rock Until You Drop
Raven were probably the most NWOBHM of all the metal bands I loved, they were a three piece which would always endear me to them. Rock Until You Drop was their first album and was recorded in Wallsend not far from where I now live. I made a pilgrimage to the site of Impulse Studios shortly after we moved here, but it had been [knocked down and replaced with an ugly apartment block](https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/53540733546/in/dateposted/) . As much as I loved Raven back then I can only remember seeing them once, at The Marquee, possibly in 1983... and then a 41 year gap until last week when I saw them at Trillians in Newcastle - they still rock.

This LP is loaded with great tracks, and I'd forgotten the [covers of The Sweet's Hellraiser and Action which is such fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zfw6nYu-kI).

 - Iron Maiden released Killers in 1981, I haven't seem them since 1983, although I never really warmed to them after Di'anno left.
 - The Tygers of Pan Tang released Spellbound in 1981, I saw them a few times in the 80s, once supporting Saxon I think... and then a 40 year gap until August 2022 at The Cluny in Newcastle - they were a wee bit disappointing.
