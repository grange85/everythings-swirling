In the early 80s a blues-loving school friend opened a whole world to me - over the course of a few years we saw John Lee Hooker, B. B. King, Buddy Guy & Junior Wells, as well as a lot of British blues greats. I never got to see either of these guys, Elmore James was dead before I was born and I don't think Muddy Waters toured after my Damascus conversion, but these two songs were a core part of my education!

### Day 15 / Song #1<br/>Muddy Waters - I Can't Be Satisfied (1948)
One of the first blues albums I got was a Muddy Waters compilation. I Can't Be Satisfied however was already familair because of the version on the Rolling Stones second album.

### Day 15 / Song #2<br/>Elmore James - Dust My Broom (1951)
This I was also familar with thanks to cover versions probably most familar at the time was ZZ Top's cover on Deguello. And later Dr. Feelgood's version on Mad Man Blues.
