<p>OK, I'm cheating here. Head over to Wikipedia and it plainly says that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cotton_Club_%28film%29">The Cotton Club was released in December 1984</a>, but, as I've already watched a film from 1984 (the rather lovely <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2014/01/30/50-films-1984-a-private-function/" title="50 films: 1984 - A Private Function">A Private Function</a>) <del datetime="2014-03-01T23:54:24+00:00">I thought I'd date this one from the time I probably first saw it in London back in 1985</del> <ins datetime="2014-03-01T23:54:24+00:00">(I've decided to date this correctly because it was getting confused and messy... I now have two from 1984 and a different one from 1985!)</ins>. I have vague memories of having quite enjoyed it... but I didn't this time.</p>
<p>Here's why it should have been good</p>
<ol>
<li>Francis Ford Coppola making a gangster film, which he'd done pretty well a couple of times before</li>
<li>Mario Puzo, who wrote The Godfather co-wrote this with Coppola</li>
<li>John Barry did the music</li>
<li>It had dancing</li>
<li>Bob Hoskins and Fred Gwynne</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>Here's why it wasn't</p>
<ol>
<li>The film was dingy, cliched and tired, shot off into ridiculous songs ocasionally</li>
<li>Nothing made you think it had the same pedigree as The Godfather, and often felt like a cheap knock-off</li>
<li>The music was often dull, average at best and worse, sometimes un-noticeable, it felt like jazz-by-numbers</li>
<li>The dancing was pretty good when it happened but sometimes felt shoehorned in</li>
<li>Richard Gere and Nicholas Cage (I know! <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2014/02/18/50-films-2002-adaptation/" title="50 films: 2002 - Adaptation">Two Nic Cage films</a>! Who'd have thought!)</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>Hoskins was fine - but the only real joy in the film was seeing Fred Gwynne playing Herman Gangster... and saying "fuck."</p>
<p>And lets face it, I suspect Richard Gere lies in bed dreaming of being as good looking as Fred Gwynne!<br />

<p>The Standells appeared in an episode of The Munsters (covering The Beatles), sadly that's poorly served on YouTube with just a Spanish dub ... so instead here's they are playing Dirty Water<br />
