A mostly dreadful story and some decidedly average acting is barely rescued by a few imaginative Hitch offerings. And even if Hitch's genius had shone brightly - the dreadful story would still overshadow it.</p>
<p>Our DVD copy was silent... not as in a "silent film" but as in a film with no sound... at all. After 10 minutes we opted to put on a record, and chose one we'd picked up at a charity shop a couple of months ago. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Hatto">Joyce Hatto</a>'s <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Joyce-Hatto-Music-From-The-Films/release/2583129">Music from the Films </a>was an authentic Hatto recording from the early 60s rather than from her later, fraudulent catalogue.</p>
<p>The music fitted surprisingly well, not always, but often enough to make its fit more enjoyable than the film itself.<br />
