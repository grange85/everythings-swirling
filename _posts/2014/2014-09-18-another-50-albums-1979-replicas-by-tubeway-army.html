In 1979 Motorhead ruled my life. My mate Paul was a fan of Tubeway Army and The Police. I was proud that I converted him to a Motorhead fan. Over the years I have grown to love electronic music but I've steered clear of Tubeway Army and Gary Numan - I imagine a fair bit of that is down to Numan's Thatcher-loving past - frankly he always came across as a bit of a prat (and as far as I can tell, still does).</p>
<p>Today I decided it was time to give the breakthrough second Tubeway Army album Replicas a listen to see if I could get past my prejudices.</p>
<p>I couldn't - it was patchy and only very rarely interesting. Mostly it was ordinary and quite often not very modern sounding at all  - and lets face it the best electronic music sounds like the future regardless of how many years ago it was made! It makes sense that Are 'Friends' Electric? was a hit but there's very little else on the album that rates it a second listen...<br />
