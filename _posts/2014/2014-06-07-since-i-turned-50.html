<p>After rattling through almost 130 posts during 2014 until I reached 50 ... I then stopped. Partly because the 50 albums project came to an end, and partly because the week after my birthday was so full and mind-bendingly awesome that I never got a chance... and by then I'd fallen out of the habit.</p>
<p>My family treated me to a Luna rarity for my birthday... which was a beautiful surprise<br />

<p>The day after my 50th birthday (Sunday 18th) I went and saw Damon & Naomi showing Naomi's film Fortune and performing, at Caf&eacute; Oto... at the end of that show, this happened...<br />

<a href="http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2014/05/damon-and-naomi-at-cafe-oto-18th-may-2014/">More about that evening on A Head Full of Wishes</a>.</p>
<p>The Wednesday, Thursday and Friday was spent following Dean Wareham around the bottom half of England, and ended with a particularly splendid night at the Islington Assembly Hall, and a bar and van afterwards - I <a href="http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2014/05/photos-and-words-dean-wareham-in-london-23rd-may-2014/">babbled about that at length on A Head Full of Wishes</a> if you care.<br />

<p>The week after that I became the father of a seventeen year old boy.<br />
