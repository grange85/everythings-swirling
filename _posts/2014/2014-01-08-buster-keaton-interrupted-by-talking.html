The <a href="https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=busterkeaton">BFI is kicking off a short season of Buster Keaton films</a> and last night I went to an introductory talk by curator Geoff Andrews. The talk was "the length of a feature film" and packed with clips, not only of Keaton films, but modern films where Keaton's influence can maybe be seen.</p>
<p>I came home and dug out my Keaton box set because, as fascinating at the talk was, it couldn't help but be some brilliant bits of film interrupted by talking!</p>
<p>Here is probably the best 20 minutes ever committed to celluloid</p>
