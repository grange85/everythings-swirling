Today on A Head Full of Wishes I posted <a href="http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2014/08/originals-guitar-gently-weeps-beatles-covered-damon-naomi/">Damon & Naomi's cover of The Beatles' (well George's) While My Guitar Gently Weeps</a>... it's a lovely cover but not in my top 6...<br />
actually these aren't really my top 6 either... just the first six that popped into my head right now! #1 is probably #1 though!</p>
