I don't like Kubrick's films. I was disappointed in The Shining (mostly because I had loved the book so much), am baffled by the Strangelove love and A Clockwork Orange is just hatefully unpleasant. For all those reasons I had decided that I wouldn't like 2001 and managed to reach 50 without ever having seen it. </p>
<p>However I love film (and have a fondness for sci-fi), and it's been preying on my mind lately that there is this supposed classic sci-fi film I haven't seen, so when the BFI offered free tickets in a members event I felt obliged to go.</p>
<p>I genuinely tried to view the film with an open mind (and I was eased into the mood by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Harlan">Jan Harlan</a> being so funny and knowledgeable and charming in the Q&A beforehand)... </p>
<p>... but it's painful, pretentious toss. There's a technically brilliant middle section, with some nice model work - but even that's bordering on the tedious. I am fond of a story that burns slowly, but this didn't really burn. What little story there was was telegraphed early and delivered in such a way that it even made <em>me</em> tired of the model work (and I love models!). And then the last 20 minutes completely killed any love that the technical wonders had generated.</p>
<p>The music and sound were mostly brilliant.</p>
<p>I'd rather watch Gerry Anderson's model work, Space: 1999 had all that with excitement and a story wrapped up in less than an hour.<br />
