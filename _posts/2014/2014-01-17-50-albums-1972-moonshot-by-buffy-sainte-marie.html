Ahh... it was a long time coming, but finally we have a Galaxie 500 connection. I knew <em>of</em> Buffy Sainte-Marie a long time before I really knew her. In November 1990 John Peel broadcast Galaxie 500's second Peel session that included a cover of Moonshot, and even then I didn't really know Buffy. That's because I never listened to Peel that night. I know I didn't because also as part of that session they recorded a cover the Sex Pistols Submission and a week or so afterwards they played their last London show at ULU and the guy in fromt of me screamed "Submission" between every song and I remember wondering what the hell he was shouting for!</p>
<p>Then four years later the internet arrived, and with the internet came encounters with other Galaxie 500 fans, and then a cassette tape of the Peel sessions and finally I knew Moonshot, but still I barely knew Buffy.</p>
<p>At some point between then and now the internet has taught me more. But still I've not listened to Moonshot, the album, nearly as much as I should have - it is (mostly) truly beautiful.</p>
<p>As I shouldn't pick Moonshot, here's my another fave track on the album because I'm an absolute sucker for a love song, and a love song with strings and listen to that brass! Such sweetness is hard not to love:</p>

<p>Over on <a href="http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/">A Head Full of Wishes</a> I've been blogging about the <a href="http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/list-originals/">tracks that Galaxie 500 (etc.) have covered</a> over the years - that series reaches Moonshot next week.</p>
