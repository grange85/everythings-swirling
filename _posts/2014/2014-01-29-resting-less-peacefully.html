<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scott2403photos/12190087336/" title="RIP Pete Seeger by Nature Photos by Scott, on Flickr"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3753/12190087336_fff2b10445_z.jpg" width="640" height="440" alt="RIP Pete Seeger"></a></p>
<p>I never slept well last night, and the passing of Pete Seeger kept drifting in and out of my head, the following thoughts occurred to me.</p>
<p>If there's an afterlife it's going to have a lot more singing in it now - I love the way Pete always made the song the star of a performance, and encouraged everyone to sing along.</p>

<p>When someone has a full life and dies at a ripe old age I'm inclined to feel that rather than mourning, we should be celebrating... but that doesn't apply for Pete Seeger - a world without Pete Seeger is a very much diminished one, we should be mourning for a world that has to get on without him.</p>
<p>We should all rest a little less peacefully without Pete Seeger to be a champion of song and people.</p>
<p>This afternoon I read the <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/01/28/pete_seeger_huac_transcript_full_text_of_anti_communist_hearing_courtesy.html">transcript of Pete's appearance before the HUAC in 1955</a> - in which he deals with incredible dignity an outrageous grilling - this made me smile... I assume he actually sang the last line - which makes it beautiful and funny and remarkable.</p>
<blockquote><p>
MR. SEEGER: My answer is the same as before. Of course, I would be curious to know what you think of a song like this very great Negro spiritual, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Gonna Lay Down My Sword and Shield, Down by the Riverside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MR. TAVENNER: That is not at all responsive to my question.<br />
