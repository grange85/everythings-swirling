Yep, for 2002 I chose the (recent-ish) Nicholas Cage film it's OK to love, and I do rather love it. Cage is genuinely great, I guess he's the sort of actor who needs the right role, rather than being able to make a role right. The rest of the cast is pretty good too, but the film isn't really about them is it? And it isn't about Nicholas Cage either.<br />
