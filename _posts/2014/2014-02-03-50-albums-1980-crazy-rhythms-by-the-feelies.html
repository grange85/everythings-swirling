  (or very early 90s) I bought Crazy Rhthyms, I'm not sure why, but wouldn't be surprised

  Galaxie 500, and seen and loved The Chills, and then there was Stanley, of The Feelies,
  and all I had was Crazy Rhythms... and Stanley didn't even play on that. This needed
  fixing, and I fixed it as best I could over the next few years. I'm still fixing
  it by mopping up all the f<a href=\"http://thefeeliesweb.com/bio/projects.html\">abulous

  and carelessness, I've never seen The Feelies live, and it seems unlikely I ever
  will, neither me nor them seem keen to visit each others continent so those insanely
  long shows with endless encores will have to be something I live through the words,
  and videos and <a href=\"http://www.nyctaper.com/2010/07/the-feelies-september-12-2009-woodstock-ny-flac-and-mp3-downloads-streaming-sample/\">audios</a>

  living.\r\n\r\nI love The Feelies so much now, I find it astonishing (and shameful)
  that I let them slip by for so long.\r\n\r\nAnd here's the song I probably love
  most of all - first in 1987\r\n"

<p>Oh, you won't believe how hard it was not to do a metal album for 1980 - in 1980 my entirety was tied up in British metal and as I went through the list of albums released in 1980 I so wanted to pick one of those albums I loved back then... but then so many posts in this series have (or will have) the shadow of my metal years over it.</p>
