I have the double LP of Stevie Wonder's Songs in the Key of Life bought way back when, possibly not in 1976, but probably not too long afterwards. One of the records is broken, I have no idea why. I have a 'Premium' subscription to Spotify where I can listen to the album at my leisure. Yesterday while flicking around on my phone Google told me that I could buy the album (that I already have both physically and virtually) for just 99p. That's less than a quid for an album, I couldn't help myself, even if the album is not really all that great.</p>
<p>It has its moments, and is sometimes brilliant but, like so many double albums, suffers it from its length. And lets face it, no album with Isn't She Lovely or Ebony Eyes on it is ever going to be considered a classic!</p>
<p>Wikipedia has just told me that my fave song on the album, Another Star, is being used by the BBC in their World Cup coverage. That must be because they couldn't find any Brazilian music to use. I posted about why I'm not watching the World Cup in this <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2014/06/12/another-50-albums-1964-nara-by-nara-leao/" title="Another 50 albums: 1964 - Nara by Nara Le&atilde;o">previous post by Brazilian artist Nara Le&atilde;o</a> - I've also managed to post <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2014/01/10/50-albums-1968-os-mutantes-by-os-mutantes/" title="50 albums: 1968 - Os Mutantes by Os Mutantes">one other</a> Brazilian artist in this series (and thought I also did <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getz/Gilberto">this one</a> but for some reason didn't) - and I wasn't even trying. I even managed to post a <a href="http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2013/02/originals-araca-azul-by-caetano-veloso-covered-by-damon-naomi/">Barazilian artist on A Head Full of Wishes</a>!</p>
