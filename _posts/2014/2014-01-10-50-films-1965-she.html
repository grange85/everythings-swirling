I have a fondness for Hammer films, I know they didn't churn out much of high quality, and to be honest a fair amount of their output is... questionable - probably in content and almost certainly in artistic merit, but they took a story, and told it. Over the last few months I've re-watched a few Hammer films and I'm inclined to think that She is one of the better ones - after all, you can't argue with that cast  - Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Ursula Andress and light relief from Bernard Cribbens, and the story has some depth, which isn't always the case.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/morbius19/sets/72157637680605834/with/10861840526/">There's an awesome set of screen grabs and memorabilia on Flickr </a></p>
<p>SPOILERS AHEAD: The funny thing about She is that I haven't seen it for more than thirty (and probably closer to forty) years and can remember nothing about it ... except the end - which I remember extremely vividly. The blue flames, the fight, the aging of Ayesha, and Leo waiting - I remember all this so very clearly that it sort of spoiled my watching of it.</p>
