Watched Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent at the weekend, I do like it, but it just makes me want to watch a film I like even more. A top 10 list of my favourite Hitchcock films would probably be at least half full of his British films - and Young and Innocent would probably be in the top 3 (with The Lady Vanishes and The 39 Steps).</p>
