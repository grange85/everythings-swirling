<p>I'm not sure why I thought I didn't like The Pet Shop Boys but they're another of those bands that over the years I've avoided. There are tracks I know I've liked - I've always expressed a liking for Rent - but I can't think of anything I don't like, and surely you can't decide to not like something without actually not liking something.</p>
<p>The thing with The Pet Shop Boys is, that when pushed, there's lots to like (the droll humour, the dead pan delivery, the quiet one, Dusty etc.) and given that I can't think of anything I don't like, I have to possibly declare myself a little bit of a fan.</p>
<p>Obviously my new found fandom is currently based on this one, mostly rather excellent album, and a bunch of other singles I've encountered over the years. Sitting on the shelves opposite me there is a lot of Pet Shop Boys LPs (Hazel's been a fan for many years, she even got smiled at by Neil at Wembley Arena many years ago!) and I'll certainly find the time to dip into them, I'm sure they won't all be as great as Actually but then not all Luna albums are as good as Penthouse, and not all Beatles albums are as good as Revolver.<br />
