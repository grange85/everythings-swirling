Buffy chooses to taunt her mother by applying to other universities knowing that she's destined to stay in Sunnydale.<br />
Everyone chooses to ignore Wesley.<br />
Xander chooses to go on the road (although I believe he doesn't?)<br />

Willow chooses the two key pages from the five volume Books of Accesnsion after skimming through them in a minute.</p>
