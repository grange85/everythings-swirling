<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/3101615511" title="working-crop2 by Andy Aldridge, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3213/3101615511_a828bae651_z.jpg" width="640" height="286" alt="working-crop2"></a>BBC Information &amp; Archives, Brentford</p>
<p>In 1984 I got a job working for the BBC Film and Video Tape Library. The library was housed in a number of warehouse/factory units on an industrial estate in Brentford. I had applied for the job because I loved watching films... and I needed a change of job. After failing my A-levels miserably I had been doing a mindless warehouse job. Technically the job I got in the filmstores at the BBC was also a mindless warehouse job but it was a mindless warehouse job in a film and videotape library. I worked for the library, which became, more accurately Information & Archives for over 25 years.</p>
<p>Now, all those years working in an archive you can't help but get a love for the concept of "archive" and an appreciation of the value of archives. Towards the end of my time at the BBC I was moved out of Information & Archives and into a development team. Now I&A was in disarray and all my colleagues congratulated me on the opportunities offered outside of the archives. I, however felt lost, and betrayed. I loved the archives, and I loved what I had achieved for the archives and I felt a sad that clearly I&A didn't see my worth (not suggesting I was of great value but surely I had some).</p>
<p>My new job was a directionless mess, with repeated management changes and each new manager clueless about what to do with the team. I didn't know it at the time, but I needed a way out and when a job turned up at The National Archives it was an opportunity to go "home" - I'm not an archivist, I have no qualifications in that area, and any skills and knowledge I have, have been attained through all the years working in an archive, and living with an archive cataloguer.</p>
<p>But I love the the idea of being in an archive. I love that I now sit in an office in a building with hundreds of years of history underneath (and beside) me, and I know that archives are valuable and important and of immense use.</p>
<p>That value, importance and usefulness can be found in many ways. <a href="http://publicservicebroadcasting.net/">Public Service Broadcasting</a> have taken "archive" and turned it into one of my favourite albums of recent years, possibly one of my favourite albums of all time.</p>

<p>Inform - Educate - Entertain is an eleven track demonstration of a love of history, a love of archives, and a love of how the past is hugely relevant for the present.</p>
<p>It's fairyland, the whole album is in fairyland!</p>
<p>A few years ago BBC I&A put out a promo CD that had the clip of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Woodrooffe">Lieutenant Commander Thomas Woodroffe</a> drunkenly describing the Spithead review in 1937, it was one of the sweetest and funniest clips I'd heard, something I could never get tired of hearing. Public Service Broadcasting have turned that into something I can love all over again.</p>

<p>The rest of the album is just like that. Beautiful little archive treats wrapped in a vibrant and colourful, musical blanket!</p>
<p>I was just telling some people to shut up talking.</p>
