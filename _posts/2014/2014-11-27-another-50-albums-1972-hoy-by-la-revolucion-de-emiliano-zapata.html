On the back of <a href="">Lone Star</a> I decided I should have a poke around some Mexican music and opted to look for some Psych-rock, which led me to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Revoluci%C3%B3n_de_Emiliano_Zapata">La Revolucion de Emiliano Zapata</a> who put out a couple of rock albums in the early 70s before, apparently, wandering down more sedate paths.</p>
<p>I opted for their second LP, Hoy, that is a film soundtrack (La verdadera vocaci&oacute;n de Magdalena) - my choice was made because my search for "Mexican psych music" brought me to <a href="http://annexus.homestead.com/mexico.html">this site</a> where their second album was described as...</p>
<blockquote><p>Their second lp with long tracks, lethal fuzz and some female vocals</blockquote><br />
... which was enough to tempt me in.</p>
<p>It's a decent enough rock album, with some seventies soul thrown in by those "female vocals" - not great... maybe because I was hoping for something a little beyond the expected and this is mostly pretty typical 70s rock - with only occasional hints in instrumentation or arrangement to suggest that it could have been better.</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt from the film with the band performing in it.<br />

<p>The whole film can be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WrL4r7lcik">seen on YouTube</a>... although sadly my Spanish isn't up to it.</p>
<p>Here's another clip with the band playing Otra Vez (Again) - the album version has a male vocal... but for the film the star Angelica Maria took the vocal<br />
