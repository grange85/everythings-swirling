<p><strong>2014-01-18</strong><br />
Hazel and I went on a guided walk looking at the Art Deco buildings of Bloomsbury. At first glance I'm always quite taken by Art Deco but as I look closer, or longer it looks sinister, or vulgar, and sometimes both. Whatever you say though the buildings are often eye-catching, although it helps having someone point your eyes in the right direction.</p>

<p>As often seems the way these days, my eyes tend to get drawn more favourably towards the modern or brutal architecture</p>
