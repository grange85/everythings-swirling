<p>
Mel Brooks' remake of Ernst Lubitsch's flawless 1942 comedy suffers in two major respects in comparison to the original:</p>
<p>1/ It is 40 years too late.<br />
2/ It has Mel Brooks in it.</p>
<p>The first can't really be helped (although you could perhaps question why you'd want to remake the film at all), and the second could be disputed as there are one or two of Mel Brooks' films that work perfectly well with him in it (High Anxiety for instance), but lets face it, his best films keep his appearances to a minimum (Young Frankenstein, The Producers)</p>
<p>One benefit to it being such a straight remake of the 1942 film is that it keeps Brooks on a bit of a rein.</p>
