<p>It's hard not to love Robert Wyatt. In every interview he comes across as such a thouroughly nice bloke and I'm happy to assume that this is actually the case. </p>
<p>As I came out of my metal phase in the early 80s, and during the struggle to find a direction, I became aware of Robert. Firtsly, of course, thanks to the astounding Shipbuilding (arrived at via Costello of course) - I had a lovely gatefold 7" of it, that I gave to a huge Costello fan I was friends with at work (sort of wish I hadn't).</p>
<p>On the back of that discovery I picked up a copy of Rock Bottom at a record fair. But Rock Bottom, wasn't an album to suck me in, I love it now but at the time I found it difficult, and it was filed away... and I headed towards indie-guitar music</p>
<p>Many years later an interview with Damon & Naomi where Damon sung the praises of Robert Wyatt (and Rock Bottom in particular) probably in 96 or 97, inspired me to pull out the album again (actually I had to buy myself a CD copy) and start finding more Robert to love.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dondestan">Dondestan</a> sort of passed me by, the mid-90s rediscovery coincided with Schleep and that and Rock Bottom and Ruth Is Stranger Than Richard pretty much filled my needs. This was an opportunity to fix that.<br />

<p>Of course I've been helped back into this by the lovely Unthanks who released a rather excellent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Songs_of_Robert_Wyatt_and_Antony_%26_the_Johnsons">half-an-album of Robert Wyatt covers</a>, including the title track of Dondestan.</p>
<p>Here's them covering Rock Bottom's Sea Song (which they also released on their second album in 2007)<br />
