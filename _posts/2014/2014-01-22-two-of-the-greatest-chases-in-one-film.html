<p>We were supposed to be going to the BFI tonight to see Seven Chances, but tiredness and laziness conspired to keep us at home and so we dug out the DVD so that we could at least enjoy the film, and feel bad about how much better it would have been on the big screen.</p>
<p>Seven Chances is a good Keaton film with two great chase sequences...</p>
<p>The first is hilarious and involves hundreds of would be brides trying to snare Jimmie and his (possible) $7 million.<br />

<p>The second is just breathtaking...</p>
