Turns out the hardest post (so far) has been writing about an album I've listened to more than any other...<br />

<p><em>If the postcard had been bigger,  it would have said this:</em></p>
<p>Dear Galaxie 500,</p>
<p>Just under half my life has passed since I first heard your second album, On Fire. It was the first Galaxie 500 I had heard and it was given to me on a C90 cassete by a friend in late 1989. I think he wanted me to listen to whatever was on the other side, I'm not 100% sure what that was.</p>
<p>Almost 25 years on and it still is the most perfect thing I've ever heard. I'd suggest that a month hasn't gone by when I haven't listened to at least some of it, in all of those 25 years. But more than that even, what your album did for me is to open a crack into a world I could only have dreamt of: a world of friends I've never met, and some I have; a world of music and musicians; a world of being social when I'm naturally reclusive; a world of discovering a new me.</p>
<p>That might all sound overly dramatic, but looking back over how those 25 years have panned out it was a pretty important moment when I flipped that tape.</p>
<p>Thanks, Andy</p></p>
<p>Seriously, if you want to know what the inside of my head sounds like most of the time:<br />
