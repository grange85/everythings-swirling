<p>Hazel and I wandered east to Poplar to see a lovely interview and Q&A with Angela Lansbury, she talked for an hour and a half and had lovely and funny stories, and was wonderfully down-to-earth, and rather splendidly still a bit of a Londoner, for someone who'd been in America since she was 15!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ipernity.com/doc/moley75/album/642973?with=31683153">Hazel took a bunch of rather lovely pictures</a>.</p>
<p>We also wandered round Tower Hamlets cemetery park beforehand, and Goldfinger's proto-Trellick Balfron Tower afterwards.<br />
