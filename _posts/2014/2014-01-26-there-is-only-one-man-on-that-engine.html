Last night at the NFT we saw two of the greatest of all films on one bill. One Week has everything that makes a great Buster Keaton film all squished into a 20 minute short. It is probably the most perfect film ever made because it does so much in it's short running time and yet nothing ever seems rushed or crow-barred in.</p>
<p>One Week (1920)</p>

<p>The General (1926) might be even better, but only because it's longer!</p>
