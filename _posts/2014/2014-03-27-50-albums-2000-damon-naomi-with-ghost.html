Now, More Sad Hits always tops the AHFoW poll, and I may even vote for it myself some years. It is a wonderful album. I suspect it tops the poll because lots of fans of Galaxie 500 and Luna only own one Damon & Naomi album, so that's the one they vote for. I'm always rather surprised that, after hearing how great that album is they don't go on and buy more.</p>
<p>If however someone were to ask me where they should start with Damon & Naomi I'd more likely choose With Ghost as the perfect starting point. Not because I think it's greater than any of their other albums, although sometimes I think it might be, but because it is the album that seems to have the fullest introduction to what drives them.</p>
<p>Also it opens a door to Ghost, which is a door worth sticking your head around now and then.</p>

<p>For some reason Damon & Naomi don't have the album on their bandcamp, but a few tracks from it are on their Sub Pop Years comp which is:<br />
