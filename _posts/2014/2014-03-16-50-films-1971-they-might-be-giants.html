I'd not really heard of the film but the premise sounded intriguing. It's charming and funny, it has a message that is subtly and sweetly delivered, and it is well acted - particularly by the two leads. It is far from perfect, but a watcher all the same.<br />

<p>It's also treated with another great John Barry score.</p>
