<p>This is a rehash of a couple of posts I made to the Galaxie 500 Mailing List a couple of months back - it seemed a shame for my insane megalomania to vanish into mailing list obscurity</p></p>
<p><b><u>Part one</u></b></p>
<p><b>A PARAGRAPH BECAUSE A SMILEY MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH</b></p>
<p>I'm on a rant so while I believe everything I'm about to write please<br />
be aware that this is my own opinion and is not a personal attack on<br />
anyone. I believe everything I'm about to write but I don't want<br />
anyone taking it personally...</p>
<p></p></p>
<p><b>WRONG! WRONG WRONG WRONG!!</b></p>
<p>Music should be partisan. The fact is that I do have the VERY VERY<br />
best taste in music. And anyone who likes Celine Dion or Hall and<br />
Oates is plain wrong - anyone who was disappointed in The Clientele<br />
has cloth ears and all this "we all love music so it's fine" attitude<br />
is utter nonsense. It gets really granular - I, for instance, don't<br />
get how anyone could think Luna were greater than Galaxie 500 - you're<br />
wrong (Darren - OK that was personal :-)</p></p>
<p><b>MAKING MUSIC</b></p>
<p>I can give genuine reasons about how the music I like is ACTUALLY<br />
BETTER than, say Coldplay or U2 or Feist (!) - there are things like<br />
passion and feel and edge and anger and emotion and love and rejection<br />
and embrace and smooth and sharp and cream and sugar and lemon and<br />
lime that go into making music - and sometimes it works and sometimes<br />
it doesn't - but there IS good music and there IS bad music - it isn't<br />
ALL subjective.</p></p>
<p><b>HEARING MUSIC</b></p>
<p>The fact that, for the most part, the music that sells in huge numbers<br />
is generally pretty lame means that there is an issue also with the<br />
way people hear music. When you ask someone what music they like and<br />
they don't get passionate then they don't understand music and if they<br />
don't understand music then their opinion is valueless. There are<br />
other things that influence taste such as age, environment, sexuality,<br />
politics - all of these things make music opinion as a subjective<br />
thing questionable - a little girl who likes to scream at boy-bands<br />
doesn't have a relevant or valuable opinion.</p></p>
<p><b>THE FACT IS</b></p>
<p>That anyone who is passionate about music (at its purest level) has a<br />
right to think that they also have the VERY VERY best taste in music -<br />
they have earnt that right through love and passion and understanding.</p></p>
<p><b>AND ANOTHER FACT IS</b></p>
<p>That my listening is affected by the same afflictions of emotion and<br />
environment as I level at other people and therefore my argument is<br />
completely redundant and I should just shut up.</p></p>
<p><b>SO WHAT WAS THE BLOODY POINT OF ALL THAT THEN?</b></p>
<p>I guess my point (apart from the fact that I have perfect taste in<br />
music) is that only someone who is passionately moved by music is<br />
really entitled to respect of their tastes - and there aren't that<br />
many of people who are that passionate. Sure if you are moved by Hall<br />
and Oates that's fine - but most people aren't - most people just hear<br />
music like a backing track or an accompaniment or a funny joke or a<br />
nice dance or something to put you to sleep.</p></p>
<p><b>MY ARGUMENTS ARE FLAWED</b></p>
<p>But my taste is beyond question :)</p>
<p>If you couldn't argue and be opinionated about music (or politics or<br />
sport (preferably NOT ON THIS LIST:)) then life would surely be a less<br />
rich thing.</p></p>
<p><b><u>Part two</u></b></p></p>
<p>I don't get people who are happy to accept other peoples musical<br />
opinions because "it's thier choice" - I genuinely think that without<br />
a partisan attitude to music we may as well all be listening to<br />
elevator music. <i>I believe that you have to have an attitude because<br />
without the ability or desire to justify your tastes there is no point<br />
in having taste</i>.</p></p>
<p><b><u>Part three</u></b></p></p>
<p>IMO you can't accept that<br />
all music is equally valid and it's only people's perception that<br />
changes. It means that all music is equally good which is just plain<br />
wrong.</p></p>
<p>Just because my mum (and a billion mums around the world) loved Daniel<br />
O'Donnell records doesn't mean for a minute that we have to accept<br />
that becuase it illicits emotions it is valid musically. It's shite -<br />
and in a lot of ways it was created solely to illicit those very<br />
emotions so not only is it shite but its manipulative shite.</p></p>
