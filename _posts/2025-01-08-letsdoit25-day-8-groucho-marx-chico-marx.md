### Day 8 / Song #1 <br/> Groucho Marx - Lydia The Tattooed Lady (1939) (from the film [At The Circus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_the_Circus)) 
This is perfect Groucho and since it's Groucho it works almost as well without the moving pictures as it does with them.

At The Circus may not be the Marx Brothers finest but it not only has this, Chico doing [Beer Barrel Polka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXAVISpS4wM) it also has the lovely Eve Arden!

### Day 8 / Song #2 <br/> Isham Jones & his Orchestra, vocal by Eddie Stone (1932)
I have a single from the 80s which has Groucho and Chico (on one side) and Harpo (on the other) all doing their take on Everyone Says I Love You from their 1932 film [Horse Feathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_Feathers) but Isham Jones & his Orchestra perform the _proper_ version that was released along with the film.
