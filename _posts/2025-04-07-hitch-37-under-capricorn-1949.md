I have to admit the premise of _Under Cparicorn_ doesn't sound like it's going to be my cup of tea, a period drama where...

<blockquote>
A young gentleman goes to Australia where he reunites with his now married childhood sweetheart, only to find out she has become an alcoholic and harbo[u]rs dark secrets.
</blockquote>

... but it pulls you in, for so many reasons from the big ones, Ingrid Begrman being the biggest, to the little ones, Cecil Parker being so... well... Cecil-Parker-y.

I love the way that Hitch teases you along laying the seeds that the "young gentleman" - the layabout, posh boy - is going to get back his sweetheart, and even, at some points has you rooting for him (it helps that Michael Wilding plays Charles with a glorious louche charm), and the way that Sam is set up as the bad-tempered villain, when the real villain is playing him along so perfectly.

But Ingrid is the real star here, being... drunk Hattie, vague Hattie, bewitched Hattie, resolute Hattie, faithful and genuinely in love Hattie - all so perfectly, and all played without straying too far from just being beautiful Ingrid Bergman.

The film drops pace, and becomes a bit wordy at times, but it has the right ending (although seeing Milly getting her comeuppance would have been good).
