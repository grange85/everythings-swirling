A couple that are here for more modern reasons...


### Day 23 / Song #1<br/>Cab Calloway - Minnie The Moocher (1931)
Here because of The Blues Brothers, where I first heard it, and because of Betty Boop

### Day 23 / Song #2<br/>The Nat King Cole Trio (Get Your Kicks on) Route 66 (1946)
Here because of The Rolling Stones and Dr. Feelgood - and also as a nod to my mum who loved Nat King Cole. I remember sitting down with an atlas in the library trying to figure out the names of the towns mentioned... I should have just listened to Nat's version, he enunciated them so much more clearly than Mick or Lee!
