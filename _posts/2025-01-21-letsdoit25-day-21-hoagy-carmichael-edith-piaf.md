Today we have two artists, and one song, putting in a second appearance.

### Day 21 / Song #1<br/>Hoagy Carmichael - My Resistance is Low (1951)
So, after falling for Hoagy thanks to his appearances in [To Have and Have Not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Have_and_Have_Not_(film)) ([already represented in this series](/swirling/2025/01/10/letsdoit25-day-10-billie-holiday-hoagy-carmichael/)) and [Young Man With a Horn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Man_with_a_Horn_(film)) I went out and bought two LPs, both were loaded with tracks I fell in love with and picking out one was so hard - but this is the one I picked:

### Day 21 / Song #2<br/>Edith Piaf - La Vie en Rose (1947) **BONUS 11 POINTS**
As much as I love [Louis Armstrong's version](/swirling/2025/01/04/letsdoit25-day-4-louis-armstrong-ella-fitzgerald/) this is the one I love most, and the one that gets the last of my bonus points.
