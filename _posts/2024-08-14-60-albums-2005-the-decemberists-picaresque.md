I've had a slightly unusual relationship with The Decemberists. I listened to the first couple of albums relentlessly around the time of release, when I was tipped off to them on The Galaxie 500 Mailing List. I saw them first in a breathtaking performance at The Water Rats in October 2004. Picaresque was their third album, and probably their best - certainly the one I like the most although by the time it came out I was enjoying them less than I had... I'm not really too sure why.

I bought the next album, The Crane Wife, but I didn't feel the need to listen to it a lot. I saw them three or four more times, the last time at The Shepherds Bush Empire in 2007. In 2009 I had a ticket to see them in London but The Clientele played at The Luminaire that night and... no brainer. And that was pretty much it.

Whenever I dip into The Decemberists, it'll be one of those first three albums, and probably Picaresque. I do love the yarns, and the arrangements, and Carson Ellis's art that wraps around their art,  and am enjoying giving Picaresque a spin now, but suspect it'll be a while before I dig it out again.

I also saw them at the LSE in November 2004, but it looks like I didn't take my camera to that one, but my pal Andy took his recorder so...
