After the shock of (and slight nausea induced by) seeing <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/grange85/journal/2007/05/3/412799/">all the scary footware on display</a> at last week's Howe Gelb and Friends show in London I thought it was time to track down and reassure myself that indie-pop stars do in fact wear sensible shoes.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
No.1: <a href="http://www.throwingmusic.com">Kristen Hersh</a> in some very sensible Birkenstocks (probably - I'm no shoe expert although maybe I will be if I keep this series going).<br />
<br clear="all" /></p>
