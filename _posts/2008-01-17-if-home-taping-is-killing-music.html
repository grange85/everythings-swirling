<p>...how can Radiohead allow people to download their album without DRM for as little as they want...and within a couple of months have the same album top the SALES charts in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chart/albums.shtml">UK</a> and the <a href="http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_display.jsp?g=Albums&f=The+Billboard+200">US</a>.</p>
<p>People are happy to pay so don't treat them like thieves...</p>
<p><em>Actually currently In Rainbows is #2 in both the US and the UK so this post would have had more impact if I'd have made it last week...</em></p></p>
