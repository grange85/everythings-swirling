### Day 17 / Song #1<br/>Betty Hutton - It's Oh So Quiet (1951)
So Betty is the first of my choices to make a (named) second appearance - I could have picked any of quite a few but must admit that I picked this one becuase as well as loving it to peices, it has the best chance of getting Betty into the final countdown - and it would be a travesty if she wasn't there!

### Day 17 / Song #2<br/>Stubby Kaye - Sit Down Your Rockin' The Boat (1950)
I love Guys and Dolls but had to pick one that's sort of from the ineligible 1955 film - and since Stubby Kaye was Nicely-Nicely in the 1950 Broadway musical as well as the film... he wins, although [Adelaide's Lament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbY2fSbT31A) was also in with a shout!
