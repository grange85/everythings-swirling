While I was aware of Spacemen 3 I wasn't, at the time, a fan. Their live album [Dreamweapon: An Evening of Contemporary Sitar Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamweapon:_An_Evening_of_Contemporary_Sitar_Music) was recorded at The Watermans Arts Centre in Brentford, just around the corner from where I worked. I visited often, mostly to see films, but occasionally music (I saw Elvis Costello there a couple of times). During the recording of Dreamweapon you can hear a venue announcement telling folk that the doors were open for the evening's screening of Wings of Desire - I saw Wings of Desire at The Watremans, and have long worried that I blithely strolled past The Spacemen 3 doing their thing on the way to the cinema. I hope not.

But, that's how unaware of Spacemen 3 I was. I was also unaware of their split and the formation of Spiriualized until a work colleague lent me a CD of Lazer Guided Melodies, the copy with four long tracks, and everything changed. By the time Ladies and Gentlemen... was released I was a fan (and had filled out the gaps in my Spacemen 3 knowledge/collection).

My copy is a CD in the medicine box package and because of that:
 - the packaging _had_ to be broken to get to the CD
 - 27 years of love have taken their toll on the cardboard box

... and I love it all the more for that. CDs, in jewel cases, don't age, the case might get scratched or cracked but you put it in a new one and, Hey Presto, a mint copy again. But artefacts that are loved _should_ show that they are loved. They should have creases and scratches, and biro-scribbled declatrations of love. So, Ladies and Gentlemen is one of the few CDs that I actually love as a _thing_ as well as for the music.

By the time the album was _properly_ released, the Presley estate had put the kibosh on the title track's use of [Can't Help Falling in Love]() but once again the Galaxie 500 Mailing list came through and someone sent me a CD with the _proper_ version. Apparently come 2009 the Presley estate saw the error of their ways (and the opportunity to make a few quid probably helped) and subsequent copies have that version.

I saw Spiritualized quite a lot around then, but the last time was at The Royal Festival Hall in October 2009 playing Ladies and Gentlemen in full - it was breathtaking! The whole show is on YouTube:

I just found my ticket, it was Â£36.25, it was a great show, but that was a hell of a price back then - probably the most expensive tickets I'd ever bought, and would ever buy until Kate Bush in 2014 - which is unlikely to ever be overtaken, unless Kate plays again!
