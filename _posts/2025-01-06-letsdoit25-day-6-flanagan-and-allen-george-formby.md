Rather shocked that I've reached day six before the UK puts in an appearance

### Day 6 / Song #1<br/>Flanagan and Allen - Run Rabbit Run (1939)
My dad would often talk fondly of "The Crazy Gang" but I never took much notice, I was too caught up in The Goons, the other act he talked of fondly - The Crazy Gang appeared tame next to them. But, of course, it all sunk in anyway and Flanagan and Allen's comic and musical delivery oozed charm (that word again).

### Day 6 / Song #2<br/>George Formby - I'm The Ukulele Man (1940)
This was from the 1940 film [Spare a Copper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spare_a_Copper). I always had a fondness for George and his films, which often seemed to puzzle/surprise people, but the "George" in films is such a sweet character and the seaside postcard sauciness of his songs are adorable.
