<div>I was going to go for Oz again although he actually did get a fair bit of screen time, he just sadly wasn&#39;t well enough used (see also Dawn) - there were plenty of one-offs I would happily have seen more of (<a href="http://moley75.posterous.com/30-days-of-buffy-day-18">Hazel mentions a couple</a>)... but I&#39;m going to pick one who was I think only in two episodes and they were both pretty good (the second one was one of the very best) so... the <b>Character Who Didn&rsquo;t Get Enough Screen Time is <span class="searchmatch">Vamp</span> <span class="searchmatch">Willow<br /> </span></b><span class="searchmatch"><br /> </span>
  </div></p>
