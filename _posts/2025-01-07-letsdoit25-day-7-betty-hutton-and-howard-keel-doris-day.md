... meanwhile, back at the movies

### Day 7 / Song #1<br/>Betty Hutton & Howard Keel - Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better) (1950) (from the film [Annie Get Your Gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Get_Your_Gun_(film)))
Someone earlier in the challenge picked the Ethel Merman version from the stage play which had me doubting my choice... but Betty Hutton has to be in my list and this is the version I fell in love with, so, it held its place... just:

### Day 7 / Song #2<br/>Doris Day - The Deadwood Stage (1953) (from the film [Calamity Jane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calamity_Jane_(1953_film)#Music))
I could have picked any number of songs from Calamity Jane (and in fact had started to write this post about _The Windy City_) but in the end this glorious opening, and introduction to Deadwood and some of its characters can't really be topped.
