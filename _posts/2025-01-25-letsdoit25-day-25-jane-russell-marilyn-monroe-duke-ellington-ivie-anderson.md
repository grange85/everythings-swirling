The last two are the hardest because it means that everything else on the long list is being left out, and there are so many more there that deserve to be here!

### Day 25 / Song #1<br/>Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe - Bye Bye Baby (from the film [Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentlemen_Prefer_Blondes_(1953_film)))
I love how this goes from Dorothy and the Olympic team to Lorelie and then... when Dorothy disturbs the lovers by slapping on the wall to a nice big finish! It's easy to forget just how great Jane Russell is in this film, not in the least overshadowed by Marilyn. Oddly I can't find the whole sequence on YouTube so it'll have to be in two parts...

### Day 25 / Song #2<br/>Duke Ellington and his Orchestra with Ivie Anderson - It Don't Mean a Thing (If it Ain't Got That Swing) (1932)
As much as I've loved so much music during this period, it is the swing orchestras that I think I love the most.
