<div>I just came across this recording I made of a solo Kristin Hersh show from 1992. I went with Jackie (not sure why Hazel didn&#39;t come) and we saw a celeb in the bar beforehand - although I can&#39;t remember who the celeb was! Anyway... the show was great and I think the recording turned out OK. Recorded using crappy passive SONY tie-clip mics to a Walkman Pro.

<p />Obviously <a href="http://kristinhersh.cashmusic.org/">Kristin is still making awesome music</a> - I&#39;m off to see her on Monday night. Her new album, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007371861?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=aheadfullofwi-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0007371861">Crooked, is great... and available as a book</a>!
