<div><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Mind_the_Bollocks,_Here%27s_the_Sex_Pistols">Never Mind The Bollocks, Here&#39;s the Sex Pistols</a><br />I sort of wanted to not like this, I wanted to say how much better The Damned were and that they never really got the love/respect that the Pistols did. I loved it for a while and my copy is one of the more worn/battered LPs in my collection. But I was always bothered by how punk The Sex Pistols were - as if they were trying too hard. But it&#39;s a great album - a couple of duff tracks but the opening 30 seconds of Pretty Vacant is pretty much the best 30 seconds of punk ever... or at least the most iconic.<br />
