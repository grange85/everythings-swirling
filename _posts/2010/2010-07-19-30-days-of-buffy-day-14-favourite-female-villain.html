<div>Oh Hazel thinks she&#39;s so very smart, she thinks she knows me so well - "it&#39;ll be Glory" she says... and it is.
<p />It shouldn&#39;t be - it should be Drusilla because of "Grrr shhh bad dog" but it is Glory because...
<p /> She was almost as funny as Dru, particularly when fighting Buffybot or having been teleported into the air; she had particularly great minions; she was part of the rather good S5 story arc; she gave all the scoobies a beating and looked great doing it - which makes Hazel&#39;s claim that "<a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2010/07/19/30-days-of-buffy-day-14/">Clare Kramer was too nice to make her properly villainous</a>" a nonsense.
<p /> So favourite villain is very obviously Her Splendiferousness
<p />
