<div>Not convinced I&#39;ll make it through this but as <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2010/07/05/30-days-of-buffy-buffy-meme/">Hazel&#39;s doing it</a> I thought I&#39;d give it a shot (one day after her)...
<p /><b>Day 1: Favorite Season<br /> </b>My favourite season is I guess dictated by characters rather than story so I&#39;m going to pick Season 3 because of Faith and Mayor Wilkins and because at the end the school gets destroyed.<br />
