<div>I managed to muscle myself into I, Splotchy&#39;s <a href="http://isplotchy.blogspot.com/2010/06/presenting-food-drink-mix.html">latest Green Monkey Music Project mix</a> - which has a theme of food &amp; drink - you can <a href="http://isplotchy.blogspot.com/2010/06/presenting-food-drink-mix.html">download the whole massive 54 song mix from the blog</a> - and you can read about how I came to choose the eight songs I chose right here...
<p /> <b>Hot Chocolate Boy - Beat Happening</b><br />Love Beat Happening and love chocolate (although not so much hot chocolate). Name drop: I got into Beat Happening when I borrowed a copy of Black Candy from Graham Linehan (of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_IT_Crowd">It Crowd</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/GLINNER">Twitter fame</a>).<br /> 
<p /><b>Red Vines - Aimee Mann</b><br /> I actually didn&#39;t know Red Vines were food until quite recently - <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk">Hazel</a> suggested this (and a few others in this list) as I was struggling to come up with ideas for a mix I thought would be a piece of cake.<br /> 
<p /><b>Cheese &amp; Onions - The Rutles</b><br />In a valiant effort to steer clear of the obvious I opted for The Rutles version of Cheese and Onions over the Galaxie 500 version. Neil Innes Rutles songs were so utterly convincing that it wasn&#39;t a surprise that the Galaxie 500 box set credited the song to Innes/Lennon/McCartney.<br /> 
<p /><b>Strawberry Fields Forever - The Beatles</b><br />Although nobody could have done The Beatles as perfectly as this. This is the peak of The Beatles genius - it was ALL downhill from the Strawberry Fields/Penny Lane single (and don&#39;t let anyone tell you different with their Sgt Pepper and Abbey Road nonsense!).<br /> 
<p /><b>Sprout and the Bean - Joanna Newsom</b><br />Joanna Newsom is unique and makes stunning music - this is both unique and stunning and provides some much needed greens to the mix.<br />
<p /> <b>Apples in the Trees - Mirah</b><br />For a short while I was tempted to do a fruit only mix but this and the above strawberries where the only survivors.<br />
<p /> <b>Ginger Snaps - Dean &amp; Britta</b><br />OK, so my valiant effort to steer clear of the obvious finally caved because I love ginger snaps and Ginger Snaps so it really couldn&#39;t not be in there. It&#39;s a song filled with wordplay.<br /> 
<p /><b>The Man Who Loved Beer - Lambchop </b><br />And nice to finish with a beer. Love this song more than anything else that Kurt Wagner has done.<br />
