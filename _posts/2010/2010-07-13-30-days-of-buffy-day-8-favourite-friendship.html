<div>I&#39;d pretty much convinced myself not to do <b>Faith and The Mayor</b> because it was a friendship built on shaky ground - she wanted a father and he wanted a goon - and they pretty much both got what they wanted. But for all that it did seem to have something real there and was sweet and managed to not be ... questionable ... which is I guess credit to the writers.
<p /> I was tempted to go for Buffy/Willow or Xander/Willow because they were friendships that endured trials - but decided to not pick one with the main characters. <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2010/07/12/30-days-of-buffy-day-8-buffy-meme/">Also liked the one Hazel picked</a>.
<p /> Already used a Faith/Mayor pic on <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2010/07/06/30-days-of-buffy-day-1-favorite-season/">day one</a> so here&#39;s a video of clips I came across with music by Rasputina (so not as objectionable as most of the songs that seem to turn up on Buffy fan vids)
