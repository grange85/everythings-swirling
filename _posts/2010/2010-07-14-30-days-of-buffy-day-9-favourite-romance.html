<div>I&#39;m <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2010/07/13/30-days-of-buffy-day-9/">utterly outraged that Hazel picked two</a>... I thought it&#39;d be perfect - she&#39;d pick Tara/Willow obviously and leave me to ponder over Willow and Oz... but oh no - she had to go and pick both - and obv being a bit more of a Buffy afficianado than me she managed to pick all the sweet moments from both of them. Oz was great, and reading Hazel&#39;s appraisal of the romance only reaffirms my decision to choose him as my favourite male character.
<p /> So anyway favourite romance is Willow and Oz - for <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2010/07/13/30-days-of-buffy-day-9/">all the reasons that Hazel mentions</a> and because of this...<br /> <br />
