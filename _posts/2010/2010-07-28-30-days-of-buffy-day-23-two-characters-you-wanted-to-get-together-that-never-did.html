<div>Oh FFS - I have to say - and maybe day 23 is a little late to say it out loud - but this meme has been pretty damned uninspiring. I&#39;m fairly sure I could have thought up much more interesting discussion points. But this is just the worst (so far) - I mean, was I watching Buffy just waiting for folk to get off with each other - was it a romance... was that all it was?
