<div>Hazel has been <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2010/07/20/30-days-of-buffy-day-16/" target="_blank">kind enough to post a bottom 10</a> so I didn&#39;t have to. There are a couple in there that I didn&#39;t mind so much.
<p /> The first time I watched Beer Bad I winced...it seemed pretty grim that&#39;s for sure so it was no surprise to find that it was not the most liked of Buffy episodes. The second time I watched it however it was completely different. Maybe because there were no great expectations, I could relax into just finding the funny bits funny (and there were plenty of funny bits) and not worry too much about anything else. Maybe because Sarah Michelle Gellar managed to go all primitive rather beautifully.
<p /> So, clunky message aside (and invariably with Buffy clunky messages should be shoved aside) the <b>Episode I Like That Everyone Hates </b>is<b> Beer Bad</b>
<p /><i>Want beer. Like beer. Beer good.</i><br />
