<div>So it only <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2010/07/09/30-days-of-buffy-day-4/">took to day 4 before Hazel and I agreed on one</a>. Favourite female character on Buffy is of course Willow because...<br />
<ul>
<li>She&#39;s cute</li>
<li>She&#39;s clever</li>
<li>She&#39;s great at looking things up on the Internet</li>
<li>She has great hair</li>
<li>She likes libraries and books<br /></li>
<li>and (as Hazel points out) she picks great partners</li></ul>All those characteristics are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/4529012373/">very obviously attractive to me</a>.
<p /> So ... <i>Favourite Female Character = Willow</i>
<p />
