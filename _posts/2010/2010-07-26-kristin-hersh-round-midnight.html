<div>I was very tempted not to go - I love Kristin Hersh to pieces and I&#39;ve been seeing her live for twenty years now - and she&#39;s still right there at the very top of her game... but I&#39;m old, and tired (really, really tired) so it was tempting to just stay at home... it&#39;s not like I&#39;d have wasted any money on the free tickets for this surprise/secret show.
<p /> But it&#39;s been three years since I last saw her and, who knows how long I&#39;d have to wait to see her again so I dragged my tired, tired carcass off to Islington and arrived just in time - I was pretty close to the last one they let in to the venue - which fortunately left me in a very sweet spot for the show... and what a show. Just under an hour of gems (off the top of my head) Hook in Her Head, Pearl, Gazebo Tree, Flooding, Quick, Mississippi Kite oh and many more... my tired head's too fuzzy...
