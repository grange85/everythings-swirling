<div>I&#39;ve found this quite tough - partly because I don&#39;t remember episodes too well - but instead remember events. For that reason I&#39;ll pick my least favourite "event" and that appears in the episode "Gone"
<p /> Spike having sex with invisible Buffy and the way that they (she!) behaves when Xander comes looking for her is just horrid, unbelievable and therefore my<b> least favourite episode will have to be Gone</b>...
