<div><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_Free_Adolescents">Germ Free Adolescents by X-Ray Spex</a><br />I had a couple of X-Ray Spex singles but this is the first time, as far as I can remember, that I&#39;ve listened to an album. And another great punk album it is - I sort of expected the albums by all of these bands to be weak with filler wrapped around the singles but this is not proving to be the case at all. All five albums so far have been incredibly strong.<br />
