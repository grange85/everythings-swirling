<div>Eurgh! This might be a cheat but I&#39;m going to pick Spike&#39;s first appearance in School Hard because...
<p />It has a genuinely evil Spike
<p />It has a healthy dose of Drusilla
<p />And it has Joyce with an axe...<br /> 
<p /> ... which ripens into a nice gag in Becoming II<br />
<p /> <b>So best Spike-centric episode is definitely School Hard!</b>
  </div></p>
