<div>I remember watching videos of shows on crappy webcams 10 years ago - but that doesn&#39;t seem to happen anymore... which is a shame. The Knitting Factory in New York had a webcam and I mentioned to Dean in an email in 2001 that I&#39;d be getting up early to watch Luna&#39;s New Year&#39;s Eve show. That was (to my knowledge) the only time I ever got name-checked from the stage at a Luna show... unfortunately the webcam was broken and I crawled back to bed and only (and barely) heard my name check on a recording of the show months later...
<p /> And now you can too... here&#39;s the recording of the last song from Luna&#39;s 2001 new year&#39;s show - it&#39;s California (All The Way) and if you listen very carefully to the intro you might, just hear my one Luna name-check...
