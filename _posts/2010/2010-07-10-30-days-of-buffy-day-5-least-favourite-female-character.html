<div>Oh hell this is too hard - there aren&#39;t any I don&#39;t like... I didn&#39;t really want to go for a potential because it seemed so harsh... <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2010/07/09/30-days-of-buffy-day-5/">not even the obvious potential</a>. I&#39;m going to pick Amy, because I didn&#39;t like her at all when she came back and introduced the <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2010/07/09/30-days-of-buffy-day-4-favourite-female-character/">lovely</a> <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2010/07/09/30-days-of-buffy-day-4/">Willow</a> to "<i>drugs</i>"... but even that seems a bit harsh - I didn&#39;t really mind Amy at all and I actually loved her when she de-ratted and re-ratted in Something Blue.
<p /> But I&#39;m going to stick with <b>Amy as my Least Favourite Buffy Character</b> just to give <a href="http://content5.catalog.photos.msn.com/ft/share0/fb31/0/Buffy_WillowKennedy_300x435.jpg">poor Kennedy</a> a break.
