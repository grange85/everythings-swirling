<div>I saw another wonderful Joanna Newsom concert last night at the Royal Festival Hall. I was lucky enough, through Twitter friends to get a ticket six rows from the front and fairly central so had a beautiful view. The show was opened (again) by Roy Harper who was (again) compelling (although the mutual gushing about each other that he and Joanna do is a little bit much - get a room for goodness sake!).
<p /> Joanna&#39;s set was stunning, playing with a small but beautifully "into it" band really suited. High point in a set of highs, was an absolutely entrancing take on Emily from Ys - but frankly the whole set was entrancing - except maybe the jokes/Q&amp;A section during the harp tuning - and even that was mostly enjoyable.
<p /> Some idle notes...<br />
<ul>
<li>No matter how hard the musician may try to convince otherwise a trombone is a comedy instrument and whenever I hear one I expect a clown in a tiny car to come on stage.</li>
<li>One of the violinists may have been a contestant on Big Brother (in Australia).</li>
<li>Despite selling out two nights at the RFH in a matter of hours, my work colleagues gave me the blankest of blank looks when I mentioned who I was off to see.</li></ul><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/4602713050/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3308/4602713050_3b113097c0.jpg" border="0" height="500" width="375" /></a><br /> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/4602712676/in/photostream/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4063/4602712676_969ec5cb3a.jpg" border="0" height="375" width="500" /></a>
