<div>I think that Hazel was a bit generous by letting Spike/Buffy off the hook because it "<a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2010/07/15/30-days-of-buffy-day-11/">was so pathetic and she kept hitting him</a>" - personally I think a romance built on stalking and violence is really no romance at all and so this one sort of walks away with my least favourite. Of course this being Buffy lots of romances were built on violence and this is <a href="http://www.screencap-paradise.com/caps/displayimage.php?pid=7515&amp;fullsize=1">certainly not the only one with a bit of stalking</a>. But this seemed to have more of the violence, more of the stalking... and more of the rather too explicit sex for a nice prude like me.
<p /> So runaway winner in Least Favourite Romance is certainly Spike and Buffy.
