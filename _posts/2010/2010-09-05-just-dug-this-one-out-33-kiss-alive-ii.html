<div>OK, the full shame of my ownership of Kiss Alive II is <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2008/06/10/just-dug-this-one-out-17-neil-young-live-rust/">documented in this previous post about Neil Young&#39;s Live Rust</a> but the long and the short of it is that I swapped a great live album for this bollocks. At the height of my metal period the music I liked was very much of the rough and ballsy British metal kind rather than this overly polished US bombast so I&#39;m not sure that even after first listen that I believed I&#39;d made a good trade. The album has no real energy - it sounds like a studio album with over-dubbed audience, although <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:nbkvu3e5andk">AMG suggests that it was sort of the other way round</a> recorded live then stdio polished).

There was a time when you could pretty much get the whole Kiss back-catalogue for virtually nothing in the cut-out bins in most record stores.
<p /> I have to admit that I haven&#39;t been rigorous in my revisit and prolific use of the skip button got me through it, but there was nothing that makes me think I&#39;ll ever go back to it.
<p />Anyway... Kiss popped into my head because of this hilarious photo that someone tweeted...
