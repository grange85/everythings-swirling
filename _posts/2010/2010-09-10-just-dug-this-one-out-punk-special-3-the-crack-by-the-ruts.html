<div>The Crack - The Ruts<br />My mate Paul was a huge fan of The Ruts and for a while this and Grin and Bear It were played extensively. I&#39;d sort of forgotten about it over the years but it really is another rather splendid punk album. It finishes with an electrifying live track Human Punk. Paul then became a huge fan of Status Quo... can&#39;t explain that at all...<br />
