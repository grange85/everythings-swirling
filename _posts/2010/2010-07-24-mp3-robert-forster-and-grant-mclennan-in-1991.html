<div>OK - I&#39;ll put the whole of this show on Mediafire tomorrow but until then here are a couple of tracks. The show was shortly after <a href="http://www.go-betweens.net/">The Go-Betweens</a> had split in early 1991. Robert came to town with a band he&#39;d picked up in Berlin and played a stonking set - for the encore he was joined by Grant McLennan for two songs (Clouds and Danger in the Past) and then did a cover of Grant Hart&#39;s 2541.
<p /> This show ranks right near the very top of my best shows ever.
