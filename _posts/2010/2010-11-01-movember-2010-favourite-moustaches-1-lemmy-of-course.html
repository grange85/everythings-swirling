<p>This is my first shot at <a href="http://uk.movember.com/mospace/586644/">Movember</a> - growing a 'tache and trying to raise money for prostate cancer - you can <a href="http://uk.movember.com/mospace/586644/">sponsor me over here</a> - and remember that while the people in this series of photos may look incredibly cool but I will look most certainly not!</p>
<p>Lemmy and his face fungus... if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_and_Marriage">Sammy Cahn had been writing his song</a> in the 80s there certainly would have been a lyric about it in there. Incredibly, in a most bizarre turn of events <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/26412141@N05/2868005175/">Lemmy actually shaved it off</a> for a while in the 90s... thankfully he saw the light and fixed everything shortly afterwards.</p>
