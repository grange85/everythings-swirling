<div>There was a short period in time when I thought <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poi_Dog_Pondering">Poi Dog Pondering</a> were great. I remember playing Wishing Like a Mountain and Thinking Like the Sea a lot... and awful lot. I bought the follow up album (Volo Volo) and am not sure I&#39;ve ever even listened to it once. The time came and went. I remember seeing them at the Powerhaus around then as well... I enjoyed that to.
<p /> It&#39;s probably 15 years or more since I last listened to this and it was like listening to someone else&#39;s past. It is nothing like anything I like now and nothing like anything I was into back then either ... I really can&#39;t figure it out at all. There are some nice tunes and some funny/thoughtful lyrics. But that&#39;s almost irrelevant.
<p /> &nbsp;I don&#39;t hate it... I just have no feelings at all for it. It&#39;s a stranger.
