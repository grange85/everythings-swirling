<div>Using <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2010/07/07/30-days-of-buffy-day-3/" target="_blank">Hazel&#39;s criteria</a> of not including songs written for the show.
<p />OK... I&#39;ll have to admit that I had to do some research here. I generally liked the music on Buffy in a kids with guitars way but most of it was pretty forgettable.
<p /> I remembered The Breeders being on... but it wasn&#39;t Pod Breeders, or even Last Splash Breeders it was Title Tk Breeders. I also remembered The Sundays being played but couldn&#39;t remember what or when - turns out it was a cover of The Rolling Stones&#39; Wild Horses which I&#39;ve probably only ever heard on the two occasions I&#39;ve watched... The Prom - ugh - that bloody umbrella - shudder...
<p /> Luckily I found <a href="http://www.buffy-vs-angel.com/music-index.shtml" target="_blank">this site</a> which helped me find a few great songs that I don&#39;t remember so <b>Favourite Song Used In An Episode</b> is...
<p /> <i>Going to Hell by The Brian Jonestown Massacre</i> as used (apparently) in the episode Faith, Hope and Trick...<br /><object><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/un3D_GC7Rlo&hl=en&fs=1" /></param><param name="wmode" value="window" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/un3D_GC7Rlo&hl=en&fs=1" allowfullscreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" wmode="window"></embed></object>
<p /> Honourable mention to Yo La Tengo who under almost any other circumstances would have walked away with the prize... but Going to Hell suits Buffy so much better than <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7pgeoW88VE">Tears Are in Your Eyes</a>. Teenage FBI by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guided_by_Voices">Guided by Voices</a> is on a Buffy album but never turned up on the show (weird)
