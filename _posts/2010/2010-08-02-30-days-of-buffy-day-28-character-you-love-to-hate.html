<div>I&#39;m never really too sure what "love to hate" means... is it like "so bad it&#39;s good"? I guess I&#39;d have to go for a baddie and I&#39;ll probably have to go for Caleb because he was such a ridiculously over the top baddie that there was nothing to love about him... except that it was Nathan Fillion - so: reasons to hate = many... reasons to love = just the one...
