<div style="text-align: center;"> <br /></div><br />I was never a fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_%28band%29">Nirvana</a> back then, I liked them enough to have bought their albums but not so much to bother going to see them live. I remember driving past the Astoria, when they were <a href="http://archivedmusicpress.wordpress.com/2009/06/10/simon-price-reviews-mudhoney-and-nirvana-live-at-the-astoria-9th-december-1989/">playing there with Mudhoney</a>, on our way to some north London pub back room to see some unknown, and wondering if we maybe should be stopping there given the press they were getting... but no! I&#39;m sure the proto-shoegazers we were undoubtedly off to see where just fine too!
<p /> After years of being bothered by Adam not being "into" music he suddenly is... and Nirvana are to him (at 13) what Motorhead where to me when I was 15. He currently can&#39;t get enough, constantly asking for new recordings. He got very excited when I dug out my vinyl copy of Nevermind and even wanted to know if I had any tracks by The Vaselines the other day.
<p /> Last week he came and asked for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_at_Reading">Live at Reading</a> and it was only a fiver on AmazonMP3 so down it came (I love that - it took me years to build up my Motorhead collection, he pretty much has the full Nirvana catalogue sorted in a matter of weeks).
<p /> I&#39;m not sure how Reading in 1992 fits into the grand scheme of things but the sound is impressive and the band&#39;s presence is astounding. Hearing the audience singing along to Lithium is chilling. It totally makes sense to me that this is exactly the sort of music a 13 year old should love - and I wonder what current acts have the power and presence to engender the passion that Nirvana did in the early 90s (and still do).
<p /> Listening to this album and it&#39;s clear that I probably should have stopped at The Astoria that night, having said that in 1989 I was 25 years old and had seen my first Galaxie 500 show. A month after the 1992 Reading performance <a href="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/wiki/Shows/Luna/1992-09-24">Luna would play their second London show</a> and Nirvana and I were already very far apart. The closest we got was probably as I drove up the Charing Cross Road in December 1989.
