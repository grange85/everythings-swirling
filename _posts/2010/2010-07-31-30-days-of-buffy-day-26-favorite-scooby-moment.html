<div>I guess this means an interaction between two members of the gang... and like yesterday&#39;s "saying" that&#39;s not something that can be easily narrowed down. As dialogue was pretty much covered yesterday my favourite scooby moment will be one that has no dialogue at all...
<p /> So...
<p /><b>Favorite Scooby moment is the lecture hall scene from Hush</b>...
<p /><br /> <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
