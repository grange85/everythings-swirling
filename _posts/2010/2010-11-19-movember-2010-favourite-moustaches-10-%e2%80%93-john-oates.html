<p>Really - that's not a moustache... that's been raised from an egg and trained to sit on his top lip.</p>
<p>Shocked to discover from a Google image search that Mr Oates appears to have got rid of his 'tache... that strikes me as being as silly as Lemmy shaving his off in the 90s!</p><br />

<p>No link to the music because... do I need to explain?</p></p>
<p>Thanks Scott for the suggestion.</p></p>

During November I'm <a href="http://uk.movember.com/mospace/586644/">growing a 'tache to raise money for prostate cancer</a> - come <a href="http://uk.movember.com/mospace/586644/">sponsor me over here</a>.</em></p></p>
