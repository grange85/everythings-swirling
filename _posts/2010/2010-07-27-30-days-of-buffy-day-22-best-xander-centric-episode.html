<div>Blimey! Xander-centric... my first reaction was a great big "huh!?" but then I started remembering things like Go Fish and Teachers Pet and my thought obviously became "best!?" - and then <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2010/07/27/30-days-of-buffy-day-22/">I read Hazel&#39;s choice</a> and thought... "Yeah! That was OK" so... and sorry for just leeching of Hazel but you know... <b>best Xander-centric episode will have to be (Xander&#39;s Doppelgangland) The Replacement<br /> </b><br />
<p />Hopefully some of my own thinking tomorrow!
