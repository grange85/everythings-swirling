<div>Lots of cute moments ... and lots of them probably involve Oz because, well he was really cute (and of course cool because you can be both)
<p />So here&#39;s my favourite as of today from Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered...
<p />
<div style="text-align: center;">BUFFY: I seem to be having a slight case of nudity here.<br />OZ: But you&#39;re not a rat. So call it an upside.
<p /> <br /> </div>
  </div></p>
