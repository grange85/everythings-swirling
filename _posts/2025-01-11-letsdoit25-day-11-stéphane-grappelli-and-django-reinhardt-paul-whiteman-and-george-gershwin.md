### Day 11 / Song #1<br/>Stéphane Grappelli And His Hot Four featuring Django Reinhardt - I Got Rhythm (1935)
For a long time I found the virtuosity of jazz (to be honest any shows of visrtuosity) a little tiresome but as I've grown older I've learned to appreciate it - I guess if you can play like Django you should show off? And here... it's exhausting just listening to that showing off!

### Day 11 / Song #2<br/>Paul Whiteman and his Orchestra (with George Gershwin) - Rhapsody in Blue (1924)
I guess this isn't just an amazing bit of music, but a bit of recorded history.
