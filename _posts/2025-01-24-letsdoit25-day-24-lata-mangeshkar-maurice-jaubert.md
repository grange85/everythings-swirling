A couple more from the movies


### Day 24 / Song #1<br/>Lata Mangeshkar - Hawa Mein Udta Jaye (from the film [Barsaat (1949)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barsaat_(1949_film)))
To be honest most of the Indian movie music I knew and loved was from the late 50s and 60s, so some research was required because I knew it existed before then and knew that it deserved its place! I also knew that it had to be either Lata Mangeshkar or Mohammed Rafi and Lata won out for this beauty. And of course it is also lovely to look at.

### Day 24 / Song #2<br/>Maurice Jaubert - Dans les rues de Paris (from the film [L'Atalante (1934)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Atalante))
There is nothing more beuatifully French than Maurice Jaubert's music for Jean Vigo's L'Atalante - I could have chosen any one of its cues but _Dans les rues de Paris_ is the _most_ French! When Juliette gets left behind in Paris this plays as after she gets robbed and has to look for work so she can make her way back to the boat, and to Jean.
