### Day 14 / Song #1<br/>Florrie Forde - I Do Like to Be Beside The Seaside (1909)
My grandparents lived near Bognor Regis and we holidayed every year there - this song was always sung whenever we got close to the sea. In 2021 we moved out of London and now live beside the seaside, so this song pretty much is in my head every single day.

### Day 14 / Song #2<br/>Henry Hall and his Orchestra - Teddy Bears' Picnic (1932)
It's odd that there are songs that remind me of my granny but I'm not sure I ever remember her singing them. This is one as is _I Do Like to Be Beside The Seaside_. Nellie The Elephant is another, which I chose for a previous challenge.
