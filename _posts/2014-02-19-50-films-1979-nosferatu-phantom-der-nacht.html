I love Murnau's Nosferatu. I'm not sure why I hadn't seen Herzog's remake, maybe because I didn't think it would be worthy of sharing a name with the original. Here are a few idle thoughts  after finally sitting down to watch it...</p>
<p>It's not as good as Murnau's - but I never for a moment expected it to be. Herzog has said that he made a point of using the language of horror movies, I think when you do that there is a danger of making it all seem rather obvious. The first half sometimes seemed like a humourless Hammer, the second half was much, much better.</p>
<p>It doesn't really try to beat the original, it's a very different film, with a different story and apart from some obvious references, most notably the film's title and Kinski's make-up, it probably shouldn't be considered along side Murnau's film.</p>
<p>Kinski often looks comic rather than creepy. I liked how sad and lonely the count occasionally comes across, but sometimes he just looks silly.</p>
<p>I like that Lucy is the hero, rather than just the character who suffers. Isabelle Adjani is rather good once she has a part to get her teeth into and Bruno Ganz is also rather good as Jonathan Harker.</p>
<p>I couldn't figure out why, having had the luxury of Bram Stoker's novel being out of copyright (which Murnau didn't), Herzog then rather muddles up the characters.</p>
<p>Popul Vuh's soundtrack is rather great.</p>
