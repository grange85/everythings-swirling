<p>Here's a post just in case anyone does actually look at my blog. I intend renaming and jazzing up this blog and tryiong to use it to keep on top of all my music, film and literature opinions (and anything else really).</p></p>
<p>I've spent most of the last coupld of weeks reading <a href="http://www.eclipse.co.uk/wodehouse/">Wodehouse </a>- and laughing out loud on the bus - it does mean I normally get a double seat to myself!</p></p>
<p>I've spent a lot of time listening to the new <a href="http://www.damonandnaomi.com">Damon & Naomi</a> album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00078XGMO/aheadfullofwi-20">The Earth is Blue</a>, but that goes without saying. Less that two weeks until they're in London - should be good...</p></p>
