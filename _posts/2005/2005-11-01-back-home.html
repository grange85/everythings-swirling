<p>We got back on Saturday after a week in Brittany/Normandy in the North of France - we had smashing weather and a thoroughly relaxing week of paddling, touristing and pique-nique-ing (Baguette et Fromage hmmm). (stacks more photos <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/grange85/sets/1255117/">on Flickr</a>)</p>
<p>On our return...
<ul>
<li>There were <b>NO</b> CDs or records waiting on the door mat</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.fullodwishes.info/galaxie/mailingl.php">Galaxie 500 Mailing List</a> had descended into a mish mash of bickering and jazz discussion!</li>
<li>I found out that I <b>HADN'T</b> been made redundant from the sinking ship that is the BBC Archives</li>
<li>Found out that the Galaxie 500 sessions pre-orders were shipping (but mine hadn't arrived!)</li>
<li>Our telephone (and therefore Internet) was STILL broken - it took the lovely BT a mere ELEVEN DAYS to fix it</li></ul></p>
<p>Excited to see that the fabulous "long lost" debut album by <a href="http://www.explosionsinthesky.com/">Explosions in The Sky</a>, <i>How Strange, Innocence</i> has been re-released so I can update my downloaded copy for the real deal! (via <a href="http://www.chromewaves.net/">Chromewaves</a>). I noticed that they're in London next week but almost certainly won't be able to make it.</p>
<p>The very VERY lovely <a href="http://www.allloveisdead.com">Blanket</a> have revamped their website and included a complete show for download and delectation - and it seems they're playing at the Tate Britain in London in the new year - looking forward to that!)</p>
<p>Home sweet home...</p><br /></p>
