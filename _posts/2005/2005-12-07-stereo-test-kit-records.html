<p>The excellent <a href="http://www.stereotestkit.com/">Stereo Test Kit</a> records are doing a buy two get one free offer at their web store so you can fill your boots with dreamy, melancholic Swedish pop.</p></p>
<p>The very excellent EP by <a href="http://www.audrey.se/">Audrey</a> is almost certainly a late arrival in my end of year list and the just as lovely <a href="http://www.wearesoldiers.net/">we are soldiers we have guns</a> are probably going to be thereabouts as well.</p></p>
