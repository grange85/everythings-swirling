It seems it was the only way to get a hold of this rare beauty. Thankfully "How Strange, Innocence" has finally had a re-release and is available for all to enjoy. And enjoy it you will - I'd try and describe it but I couldn't do it justice.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Buy "How Strange Innocence" from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/B000BCKFIY&amp;link_code=as2&amp;tag=aheadfullofwi-20">Amazon.com</a> | <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/B000BCKFIY&amp;link_code=as2&amp;tag=aheadfullofwi-21">Amazon.co.uk</a></p><br />
