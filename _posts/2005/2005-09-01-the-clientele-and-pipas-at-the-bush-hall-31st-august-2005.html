<p>Ahhh <a href="http://www.theclientele.co.uk/index.html">The Clientele</a> - tremendous show played in near darkness (my excuse for the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/grange85/sets/859935/">rubbish pics I took</a> - although clearly <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/unpopular/sets/860045/">not a very good excuse</a>). They played lots from the very lovely new album <a href="http://www.pointyrecords.co.uk/shopdetail.php?ReleaseID=28">Strange Geometry</a> and were joined by Lupe from support act <a href="http://www.plumasbouncer.com/llc/band/pipas">Pipas</a> for a number.</p>
<p>Pipas had earlier entertained the crowd with lovely twee songs and insanely loud and unwanted burps and farts from the technology.</p>
<p>You can listen to some Clientele new and old on their <a href="http://www.myspace.com/theclienteleofficial">Myspace</a> space.</p><br /></p>
