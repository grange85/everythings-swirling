A cracking yarn - OK I love a bit of magic and I love a bit of romance and I love a twisty plot and I love a period piece - there really was nothing not to love about this book. Charles Carter uses US president Harding as a stooge in a gloriously grisly illusion - the next day the president is dead and Carter is making an escape...</p>
<p>A ripping tale ensues and kept me gripped to the very end. Highly recommended</p>
