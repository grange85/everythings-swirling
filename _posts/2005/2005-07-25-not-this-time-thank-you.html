<p>Geoff Edgers in the Boston Globe <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2005/07/24/reunited_and_it_feels_so_bad/">finally puts into words</a> (via <a href="http://www.chromewaves.net/">Chromewaves</a>) better than I ever could just why I didn't want to see The Pixies reunion and why reunions as a whole are such a bad thing. Making it harder for new acts and perpetuating the myth that things were better in the olden days.</p></p>
<p>Admittedly it's easy for me to take such a high moral position because a <a href="http://damonandnaomi.com/frameset/frame.html?http://damonandnaomi.com/interviews/ptinterview.html">Galaxie 500 reunion is never likely to happen</a></p></p>
