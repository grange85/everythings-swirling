<p>A very lovely show from <a href="http://www.decemberists.com">The Decemberists</a> at ULU last night. I expected to feel a little sad that the band had outgrown me (and my obsessive snobbery) but try as I might I couldn't not love them. A cracking set with the band having a thoroughly good time on stage and the audience so completely into them that it just made me smile my way through it (while I wasn't mouthing along silenetly).</p>
<p>Support band The Two Gallants were fucking awful - just the worst grunge I've had to suffer since the worst years of the early 90s when so many support acts where doing that long-hair-plaid-shirts-loud-then-quiet-then-loud-again thing. Dreadful</p>
<p>There's a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/grange85/sets/1389644/">bunch of pictures I took of the lovely Decemberists on Flickr</a></p><br /></p>
