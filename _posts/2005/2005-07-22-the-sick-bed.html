<p>I always love when a band I love do covers - for so many reasons: a new interpretation of an old favourite; a nod to an influence; an introduction to something I've never heard...</p>
<p><a href="http://www.decemberists.com">The Decemberists</a> like to do a cover. A while back I came across a recording of them doing a version of <a href="http://www.pogues.com/">The Pogues</a> The Sick Bed Of Cuchulainn - which was pretty cool - mostly because it made me dig out my copy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rum%2C_Sodomy%2C_and_the_Lash">Rum Sodomy and The Lash</a> which is a damned fine album that I haven't listened to nearly enough in recent years.</p>
<p>Produced by Elvis Costello before relations between he and the band went really sour.</p>
