<p>Just got back from seeing <a href="http://www.rilokiley.com">Rilo Kiley</a> - I quite liked a couple of albums but they were a bit disappointing live - Jenny Lewis sings too much - they hop from twee to pompous to "blues" and only occasionally into the bright pop I was hoping for. They finished with <a href="http://www.rilokiley.net/lyrics/witharmsoutstretched.php">With Arms Outstretched</a> only to ruin it by orchestrating an on-stage sing-a-long with audience members. Although seeing the guy in the <a href="http://www.deadkennedys.com/">Dead Kennedys</a> shirt - trying to look cool, smoking, and singing along even though he'd obviously never heard the song before and knew none of the words was one of the high points of the evening...</p></p>
<p>Support act was a guy called <a href="http://www.marccarroll.com">Marc Carroll</a> - who I knew nothing of but was pretty good - and he did a cover of <a href="http://www.granthart.com/">Grant Hart</a>'s "The Main" which gets a big thumbs up from me - I thought about buying his record but <a href="http://www.evangeline.co.uk/Details.asp?ProductID=249">the label</a> is selling it for 15 quid - that is criminal - bit cheaper on Amazon but really...probably save my money for the new <a href="http://www.scoutniblett.com/">Scout Niblett</a>, <a href="http://www.decemberists.com">Decemberists</a> and the <a href="http://www.toopure.com/stereolab/">Stereolab</a> box...</p></p>
<p>The show was sponsored by WORD magazine - without a doubt the dullest music magazine that Britain currently produces - and with competition from Mojo and Q thats saying something!</p>
