  I have on on/off relationship with The Boss - sometimes there's nothing better, other times I don't want to listen to more songs about cars and girls. But, I have never not loved this single - I love the joy in the delivery!

I have on on/off relationship with The Boss - sometimes there's nothing better, other times I don't want to listen to more songs about cars and girls. But, I have never not loved this single - I love the joy in the delivery! Bruce and the band are having a riot and there's not much more perfect as a Christmas single.

 - [Bruce Springsteen - Santa Claus is Coming to Town](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76WFkKp8Tjs) - #9 - 1985

Funny to think that it was the b-side - although My Hometown is a gem too even if does have cars and girls in it, but not sure _I'd_ have picked it as a single.
