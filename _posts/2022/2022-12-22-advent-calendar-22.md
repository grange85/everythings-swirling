excerpt: |
  There's something so beautifully conventional about pre-Beatles (or maybe pre-Stones) British pop music - Adam Faith was a teen-idol, but definitely with his good looks, and well turned out appearance a teen-idol your parents were probably OK with.

There's something so beautifully conventional about pre-Beatles (or maybe pre-Stones) British pop music - Adam Faith was a teen-idol, but definitely with his good looks, and well turned out appearance a teen-idol your parents were probably OK with. Lonely Pup is probably the height of that conventiality - but quite sweet all the same.

Here's a [clip of him singing it to a "pup"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0_NKL2nr6I) that he subsequently gives to Alma Cogan - seriously could anything be more conventional than that!?
