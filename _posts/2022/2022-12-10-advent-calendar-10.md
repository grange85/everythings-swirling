It's probably about time to start your rewatch of [The Box of Delights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Box_of_Delights_(TV_series)) if you want to finish it by xmas eve ... which you should.

The theme was lifted from [Victor Hely-Hutchinson's lovely Carol Symphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPsOZUMB3NA).
