The Film [Perfect Understanding]() from 1933 turned up on [Talking Pictures TV](https://talkingpicturestv.co.uk/) a few weeks back and when I started to watch it I was rather taken by the lovely titles and wasn't surprised to see that they had been designed by the rather great graphic designer [Edward McKnight Kauffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_McKnight_Kauffer):

On Friday the latest [Sight and Sound magazine](https://www.bfi.org.uk/sight-and-sound) arrived and it republished an article by [Ivor Montagu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivor_Montagu) in which he mentioned being brought in to make Alfred Hitchcock's 1926 thriler The Lodger, a little less highbrow and one of his suggestions was to call in Kauffer:

> Ted McKnight Kauffer, the American poster artist who revolutionised British poster design was another Film Society stalwart. We persuaded him to draw us sinister title backgrounds.

_The whole article is on the fab [Hitchcock Wiki](https://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/Sight_and_Sound_(1980)_-_Working_with_Hitchcock)._

E. McKnight Kauffer. Kauffer was an American but had spent a great deal of time in the UK and lived with his partner (designer Marion Dorne) in a flat in Chelsea.
