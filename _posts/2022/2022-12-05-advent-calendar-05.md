  People who know me will understand how hard this was for me to not put this behind door 24! It's an absolute beauty of a single put out in Chimney Rocks! records in 2007 and features a Sonic Boom remix of Old Toy Trains

People who know me will understand how hard this was for me to not put this behind door 24! It's an absolute beauty of a single put out in Chimney Rocks! records in 2007 and features a Sonic Boom remix of Old Toy Trains that the duo had popped on the internet back in 2004. Old Toy Trains is a Roger Miller xmas song which I hadn't heard until this single was released, in fact the only Roger Miller somng I knew up to that point was [England Swings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_niLa5xXLm0).

He's Coming home was originally by The Wailers (a 60s garage band not Bob Marley's backers).
