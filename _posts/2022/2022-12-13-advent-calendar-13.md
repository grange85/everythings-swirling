Earlier in the week Hazel and I finally realised that we didn't know the order of gifts after the swans-a-swimming, the order of the Lords and Ladies, milk-maids and musicians was just a confused blur. It turns out that inconsistency may have had something to do with this. It appears that over the years the order of the last 5 gifts has been at the whim of the performer - although in recent years it has settled into the order that Joan sings...

I'll assume that everyone has a similar problem so ... here's the half-arsed mnemonic we've come up with.

After the swans its maids, musicians and posh folk - although that doesn't actually help with which musicians and which posh folk come first.

I think the song needs a beuatiful sounding soprano to do it justice and Joan is that so this is unquestionably wonderful.
