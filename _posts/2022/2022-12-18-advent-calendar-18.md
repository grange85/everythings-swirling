excerpt: |
  Egg nog (the drink) isn’t something I was familiar with - partly because it may be more of a North American Xmas tradition. Egg Nog (the single) was a promo only 7” that Luna put out in both red and green vinyl in 1992.

Egg nog (the drink) isn’t something I was familiar with - partly because it may be more of a North American Xmas tradition (although my mum was quite fond of Advocaat which seems to be quite similar), but maybe more because I don’t drink much, and never drink spirits - and certainly all the recipes we’ve seen seem to involve an awful lot of spirits.

Egg Nog (the single) was a promo only 7” that Luna put out in both red and green vinyl in 1992. The track also made it onto the b-side of the Rough Trade Indian Summer EP a few months later.

Because of the track’s existence in 2017 we started this crazy _tradition_ of making and drinking an egg nog on Christmas Eve - part of that tradition involved handing my Instagram account over to the boy - not generally a wise move!

Also … I don’t drink!
