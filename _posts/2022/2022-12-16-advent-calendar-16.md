  I do rather like John's Xmas record - it has sleigh bells and 'choirs of children' but it does rather plod along. But yes, the second best Xmas song by an ex-Beatle.

I do rather like John's Xmas record - it has sleigh bells and 'choirs of children' but it does rather plod along and it'll surprise no one that I feel that Paul's is so much better - but that should go without saying because Paul's post-Beatles output has always been consistently better than John's - and sadly John wasn't given the time to catch up. 

Happy Xmas isn't so bad - but this single has a better track on the flip...

 - [John & Yoko / The Plastic Ono Band - Happy Xmas (War is Over)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flA5ndOyZbI) #2, 1972
 - [Yoko Ono and The Plastic Ono Band - Listen, The Snow is Falling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQG46cHgZ4E)

 Obviously there are better versions of both songs

  - [Galaxie 500 - Listen, The Snow is Falling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGY_b093UR4)

But yes, John has made the second best Xmas song by an ex-Beatle.
