I loved The Goons, I think my dad imposed them upon me - but had no problem with that. To be honest a lot of my early experience of them wasn't hearing them, but reading the scripts - although I did occasionally get lucky enough to hear a show or two on the radio - or on LP - but I read more Goon shows than I heard and what I heard most was this, and The Ying Tong Song - probably on [Junior Choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Favourites).

I also read Spike's books and poetry and wathced the Q<i>n</i> series avidly.

_There are holes in the sky where the rain gets in  
They're ever so small. That's why the rain is thin_
