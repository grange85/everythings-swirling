  This is actually pretty awful, it has very little going for it beyond the title, absolutely no effort has been put into the writing of it so it just sounds what it is, a half-arsed cash-in on The Beatles' success.

This is actually pretty awful, it has very little going for it beyond the title, absolutely no effort has been put into the writing of it so it just sounds what it is, a half-arsed cash-in on The Beatles' success. Even a couple of Beatles-esque _ooh-oohs_ night have saved it but no, it is not even worth clicking on the link below...

 - [Dora Bryan -All I Want For Christmas is a Beatle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq0ncaMfAbs) - #20 - 1963

Dora was of course lovely and obv has better work to her name - like [this guest spot in a Hancock's Half Hour](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/b007jyyw) or as [Jean's mum in an episode of dinnerladies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zJ2nq7MAqA)  ... maybe hunt that down instead.
