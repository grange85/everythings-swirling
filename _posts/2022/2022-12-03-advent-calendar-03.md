Time to raid [the amazing collection of 78s that are on the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/78rpm) - this is Jimmy Dorsey and his Original Dorseyland Jazz Band playing Dixieland Band from Santa Claus Land with Pat O'Connor providing the "vocal chorus" - it's a fab little swinging number with some sweet/funny lyrics.
