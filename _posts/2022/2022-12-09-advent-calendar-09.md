Just Like Christmas is the Christmas Low track that invariably gets played but this seven inch single that came out a couple of years earlier is the most magical of Low's contribution to the season.

If You Were Born Today (Song For Little Baby Jesus) is utterly heartbreaking and so perfectly Low (which Just Like Christmas ain't) - sung by Alan but Mimi's harmonies are just heartbreaking, that and the lyrics:

> If you were born today  
> We'd kill you by age eight  
> Never get the chance to say  
> "Joy to the world, and peace on the earth"

Blue Christmas is obviously a cover of the song most famously performed by Elvis - and Mimi takes the lead for this and she makes her Blue Christmas sadder, more desloate, than any versions that have gone before it.

We lost Mimi a few weeks ago - and such a loss, It'll make Low's heartbreaking Christmas songs even sadder.

 - [Low - If You Were Born Today (Song For Little Baby Jesus)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WkNP-LQvBw) - 1997
 - [Low - Blue Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bCge-JzkWU) - 1997

Obv the whole of the [Christmas EP](https://lowtheband.bandcamp.com/album/christmas) is great and has both of the above, and Just Like Christmas, and a bunch more seasonal gems.
