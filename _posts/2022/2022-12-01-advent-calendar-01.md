Cavendish Woodhouse were a furniture retailer who in the 70s were big enough to [employ Bernie Winters for a TV ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FokmvsyAQ) and to license a bunch of Xmas classics for a promotional single ... well maybe not all four are classics ... but let's see:


 - [Johnny Mathis - When A Child is born](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy_WbJFAhGo) - #1 - 1976  
 It's all about Johnny's gorgeous voice - the song... not so much.
 - [Dana - It's Gonna Be A Cold, Cold Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vMR3bt3ibg) - #4 - 1975  
 Sweet, maybe too sweet and gets tired very quickly.
 - [Elton John - Step Into Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWMqfKjJoKc) - #8 - 1973  
 Not a huge Elton fan, but he has his moments and *this is unquestionably one of those!*
 - [Linda Lewis - Winter Wonderland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPrW9KvJQBM)  - Didn't chart - 1976  

 Gets better when Linda gets all disco - definitely more fun than Dana!
