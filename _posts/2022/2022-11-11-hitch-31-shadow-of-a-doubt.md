If anyone were to ask me what my favourite Hitchcock film was I’d probably pick randomly from The 39 Steps, Young and Innocent and The Lady Vanishes - [when I wrote of the last of these three]({{site.baseurl}}/swirling/2018/08/14/hitch-24-the-lady-vanishes-1938/) (back in 2018!!) I speculated that the only other film that might muscle its way into the list would be Shadow of a Doubt.

We finally arrived there a few months back and while it’s certainly in with a shout I’m pretty sure that (apparently) Hitch’s favourite film is not mine - although there is so much to love about it…

Weirdly, one of the things that has always stuck in my head since the very first time I watched Shadow of a Doubt is that you don’t start a cake by breaking an egg.

So ...

* not my favourite Hitch film
* probably my favourite US Hitch film _(although there're plenty more of those to come)_
* useful baking tips

_I've just noticed that we are over eight years into our Hitch rewatch - and we've only just reached [Lifeboat (which I posted when we watched it out of sequence in Feb 2021!)](/swirling/2021/02/12/hitch-32-lifeboat-1944/) - we need to up our game! Hazel's posts are on [Let's Fold Scarves](https://www.moley75.co.uk/category/hitchcock/) and tend to be more detailed/analytical than my idle half-arsed rambling_
