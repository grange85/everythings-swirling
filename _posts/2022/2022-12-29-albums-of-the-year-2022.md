  It seems to have been a year where I've spent a lot of time listening to music that reminds me of my past ... I guess I've reached that age? Lots of folk and indie, some glam, some metal, bits of jazz and swing.

It seems to have been a year where I've spent a lot of time listening to music that reminds me of my past ... I guess I've reached that age? Lots of folk and indie, some glam, some metal, bits of jazz and swing. 

Almost all the music I've bought has been either on record, or digital - and then only if it's on Bandcamp. There are probably others I've missed or forgotten but these are some of the albums released in 2022 that I have loved.
