  Despite my Marc/T.Rex love I was unaware of Christmas Bop until a few years ago when it turned up on Bandcamp - and while it's not a T.Rex classic - it's still Marc doing Christmas so ... pretty close! Have a Super Funk Christmas!

Despite my Marc/T.Rex love I was unaware of Christmas Bop until about 10 years ago when [it turned up on Bandcamp](https://bolan-boogie.bandcamp.com/album/t-rexmas) - and while it's not a T.Rex classic - it's still Marc doing Christmas which makes it pretty damn close to a Christmas classic!

The track was apparently recorded in 1975, I picked up this single a while back on Discogs and it dates from 1982 - it's lovely, but doesn't have Marc's lovely _super funk christmas_ greeting from 1972 so ... check that out too!
