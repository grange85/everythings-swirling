  So … we come to one of my favourite Christmas songs, I have been singing its praises on social-media for a few years - not that I suspect anyone has noticed - but it’s a work of genius - the problem with it is that most people will probably shrug it off as a novelty song from a kids TV show.

So … we come to one of my favourite Christmas songs - not sure if this is a surprise or not since I have been singing its praises on social-media for a few years - not that I suspect anyone has noticed - but it’s a work of genius (the genius that is Mike Batt) - the problem with it is that most people will probably shrug it off as a novelty song from a kids TV show - but it has the most beautiful opening lyric imaginable:

> Open your eyes, look to the skies when you're lonely  
> There will be stars shining for you

True it doesn’t get better than that, but that’s a hell of an opening. The rest is a more conventional celebration of Christmas, the snow, the warmth after the snow, the laughter and the hope. And the reassurance that the “whole wide world is Wombling too”.

Whatever you want your Christmas to be is the right way to do Christmas - and the whole wide world is (or should be) behind your decision.

Have a Wombling Merry Christmas
