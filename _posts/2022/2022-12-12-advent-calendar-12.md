This is unquestionably a relative of [I'm Walking Backwards for Christmas](https://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2022/12/02/advent-calendar-02/) just as The Goodies were a relative of The Goons. Maybe because they were on telly and normally pitched at a family audience it seems a lot more accessible - although their [other Christmas single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3AphnJLbE) was a little ... funnier, more adult, but lyrically a bit questionable (and consequently I guess a bit more successful and memorable).

Make a Daft Noise is charming, pseudo-funk-nonsense and an enjoyable enough Christmas novelty.
