This is unquestionably a relative of [I'm Walking Backwards for Christmas]() just as The Goodies were a relative of The Goons. Maybe because they were on telly and normally pitched at a family audience it seems a lot more accessible - although their [other Christmas single]() was a little more ... adult, and lyrically a bit questionable (and consequently I guess a bit more successful and memorable.

Make a Daft Noise is charming, pseudo-funk-nonsense and an enjoyable enough Christmas novelty.
