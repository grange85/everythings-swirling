excerpt: |
  Lionel Bart was a treasure - things went a bit to crap in his later years but his contribution to British popular music in the late-50s and early-60s is pretty special.

Lionel Bart was a treasure - things went a bit to crap in his later years but his contribution to British popular music in the late-50s and early-60s is pretty special. His fingers were in so man pies - early rock and roll (Rock With The Cavemen, Living Doll), one of the best Bond themes (From Russia With Love), and getting London voices onto the West End Stage (Fings Ain't Wot They Used T'Be, and of course Oliver!)

So it’s not really a surprise to find his Christmas song is also a masterpiece.
