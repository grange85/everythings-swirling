I got an email this morning from Maria, my piano teacher, telling me that I had passed the (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abrsm.org%2F&ei=n6TQRJK-KoX-QZSn4LAE&sig2=9VWGUeyMmrPNBGUXrNnJIg">ABRSM</a>) Grade 5 examination that I took a couple of weeks back. Maria's on holiday so I haven't got the nitty-gritty details (about just how woeful my sight-reading was and how much the examiner "enjoyed" my <del datetime="2006-08-02T13:11:54+00:00">honking</del> singing!) but I'm absolutely chuffed to bits (and more than a little bit surprised!).<br /><br />

Adam passed his Grade 1 theory exam as well so we can all feel a bit proud of ourselves!<br />
