_Soulful Dress - Sugar Pie Desanto (1964)_  
Back in 1984 I bought [Chess Masters - Sampler](https://www.discogs.com/release/1552796-Various-Chess-Masters-Sampler) a 14 track LP, and every track on it could have found a place in this series. Some I already knew, the famous ones, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry etc. - but I'd never heard (or heard of) Sugar Pie Desanto, and yet Soulful Dress shone brighter than everything else on that fantastic album!
