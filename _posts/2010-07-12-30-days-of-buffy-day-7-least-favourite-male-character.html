<div>This is too hard - there&#39;s no one character that annoys me consistently in Buffy - they all annoy me at times. Because the ones with the most screen time will have had the most opportunity to annoy me it means that, <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2010/07/12/30-days-of-buffy-day-7/">like Hazel</a>, I&#39;m going to have to pick Xander ... and mostly for the <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2010/07/12/30-days-of-buffy-day-7/">reasons she mentions</a>.
<p /> Ugh! Can&#39;t even be arsed to find a picture... sorry...
<p />I&#39;m glad the favourite/least favourite character thing is done now... that was a bit of a yawn - hopefully the remaining 23 days will be more stimulating.
