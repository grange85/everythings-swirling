<p class="lead">On Thursday the boy and I managed to blag our way into Luna's soundcheck at The Islington Academy in London. We were up on the mezzanine, Lee spotted us!</p>

<p>They later played Fourth of July. Luna! Playing Fourth of July pretty much to just me! And the boy. Sadly I decided to record that on my phone so it looked and sounded dreadful - and it really wasn't - it was beautiful. I applauded. Alone. And quietly.</p>
