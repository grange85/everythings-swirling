<p>I tend not to go to big, outdoor gigs anymore. I'd much rather be in a small sweaty dive than in a field so most of my big gigs are a little embarrassing...these are possibly not the biggest gigs I ever went to but are the big gigs that I remember...<br /></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Queen" class="bbcode_artist">Queen</a> - Wembley Stadium - 1983<br /><br />
I was never a Queen fan and was dragged along to this because a couple of mates were fans of support act <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Status+Quo" class="bbcode_artist">Status Quo</a> (who, because of that, I've seen far too many times for my liking). Quo were awful, hampered by crap sound and being a second-rate pub band on a huge stage. Queen however were sensational, I still don't really like them but for pure "show" I'm not sure there's too many who could match them (or <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Freddie+Mercury" class="bbcode_artist">Freddie Mercury</a> anyway - I think they really were a one man band which sort of makes the fact that they still tour a bit of a laugh)</li>
<li>Monsters of Rock - Castle Donnington - 1983<br /><br />
Not entirely sure why we went to this, maybe because of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/ZZ+Top" class="bbcode_artist">ZZ Top</a>. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Whitesnake" class="bbcode_artist">Whitesnake</a> were (I think) headlining. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Meat+Loaf" class="bbcode_artist">Meat Loaf</a> and maybe <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nazareth" class="bbcode_artist">Nazareth</a> were also on the bill as well I think. ZZ Top were good fun but played a really short set and everything else is long since forgotten. I remember lying on the floor sleeping during the headline act.</li>
<li>Reading Festival - Reading - 1989<br /><br />
I remember going to this wearing a <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jason+Donovan" class="bbcode_artist">Jason Donovan</a> T-Shirt - which seemed like a really funny idea at the time (a friend was wearing a <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Kylie+Minogue" class="bbcode_artist">Kylie Minogue</a> T-Shirt). We only went for one day, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Pogues" class="bbcode_artist">The Pogues</a> were great, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Les+N%C3%A9gresses+Vertes" class="bbcode_artist">Les N&eacute;gresses Vertes</a> were also good, can't remember much else to be honest.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Mot%C3%B6rhead" class="bbcode_artist">Mot&ouml;rhead</a> + <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ozzy+Osbourne" class="bbcode_artist">Ozzy Osbourne</a> - Port Vale - 1981<br /><br />
This was my first great excursion. Two of us got a scarily early bus from Victoria to get there early enough. There weren't enough toilets or bars. Motorhead were always great live, Ozzy was fantastic, this show turned me, briefly into a fan. A woman fell asleep on me on the coach home and drooled on my shoulder.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cult" class="bbcode_artist">The Cult</a> In The Park - Finsbury Park - 1992<br /><br />
Ken gave me a freebie to this so I went along on my own - saw a stack of great bands, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Mercury+Rev" class="bbcode_artist">Mercury Rev</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/PJ+Harvey" class="bbcode_artist">PJ Harvey</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Stereolab" class="bbcode_artist">Stereolab</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Miracle+Legion" class="bbcode_artist">Miracle Legion</a> - I stayed for a bit of The Cult's big finale but then got bored and went home.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Pixies" class="bbcode_artist">Pixies</a> - Crystal Palace Bowl - 1991<br /><br />
Another gig on my own (poor old Billy-no mates). This was the last time I saw Pixies, they were great...the slightly other-worldly Crystal Palace Bowl sort of suited the sci-fi thing that the band had going on at the time. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ride" class="bbcode_artist">Ride</a> were a good support.</li></ul></p>
