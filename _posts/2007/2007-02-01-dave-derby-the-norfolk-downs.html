<p>I dived along to the Spitz last night to catch <a href="http://www.davederby.com">Dave Derby and The Norfolk Downs</a> - The Norfolk Downs (for this gig) being <a href="http://seaneden.net/">Sean Eden</a> on guitar, <a href="http://www.chrisbrokaw.com/">Chris Brokaw</a> on drums and guitar and Sandy Smallens on bass (who, I discovered last night was not only a bassist but a <a href="http://www.digitalhollywood.com/DHLA01/DHLAWednesdayTen.html">music industry suit!</a>). The gig was pretty good, although I'm not too sure I'd rush off to buy a bunch of albums, and it was nice to see Sean throwing Sean shapes on a stage again - and it's always great to see Chris Brokaw - who I think I've seen five or six times now but never twice in the same band!</p>
<p>Sandy Smallens reminded me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Dury">(Ian Dury and) The Blockheads</a> bassist Norman Watt Roy - he looked a bit similar and had a similar very articulate stage presence - he also outrageously scrounged a pint from the stage. Chris Brokaw looked like he was playing in a living room unaware that there was anyone around him and Sean looked like Sean.</p>
<p>I chatted briefly with Sean after the show and he seemed very chipper. In all the years of Luna Sean and Stanley were the members that I never really had any contact with so it was nice to sort of set that straight. He assured me that <a href="http://seaneden.net/">his blog</a> will get a little more public when he gets back and that he is recording but things have been on hiatus while he has other work (which I guess = <a href="http://www.elkcity.net/">Elk City</a> and this amongst other things).</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/grange85/tags/davederbyandthenorfolkdowns/">a bunch of pictures from the show on Flickr</a> and I took a bit of crappy video of Sean but I need to do a bit of PP on it before I chuck it on YouTube.</p>
<p>For the sake of open-ness and showing-off here's a summary of my chumminess with the members of Luna...</p>
<ul>
<li>Dean = chats and that cup tea round his apartment and a phone message that I still have a recording of (tragic!)</li>
<li>Justin = saying hello after a gig in London and before a gig in NYC.</li>
<li>Stanley = I got an email from Stan once way back when.</li>
<li>Sean = (see above)</li>
<li>Lee = chatted after a couple of gigs and he signed a drumstick for me.</li>
<li>Britta = chatted after a couple of gigs.</li></ul>
<p>I go to gigs, dress in black and try to be all cool but the above, and the fact that I went from West to East London to see a support act I'd never heard before because the guitarist used to be in Luna proves that I am frighteningly sad - and therefore probably not cool at all...</p><br />
