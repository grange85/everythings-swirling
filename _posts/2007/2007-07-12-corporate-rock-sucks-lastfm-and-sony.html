<p>So <a href="http://www.last.fm">last.fm</a> have <a href="http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,2122340,00.html">struck a deal with ugly major Sony</a> (you know the same Sony who <a href="http://www.eff.org/IP/DRM/Sony-BMG/">care so little for their customers that surreptitiously install damaging software onto their computers</a>) - now I understand that last.fm is part of a major corporate media group and that jumping into bed with major labels was the inevitable next step but this quote from Thomas Hesse of Sony BMG was worrying...</p>
<blockquote><p>The Last.fm streaming service will give our established artists a platform through which they can reach new audiences, and its unique recommendation system will provide our emerging artists with an important opportunity to build their fan base</blockquote><br />
So they plan to use last.fm's recommendation system to promote their <em>emerging acts</em>...so the recommendation system isn't (or won't be) a genuine one but more a promotional/advertising platform for Sony? And at what cost? Independent labels? Artists not aligned with a record company? The customers who can no longer trust that the recommendations were made for valid reasons?</p>
<p>To be honest <a href="http://blog.fullofwishes.co.uk/swirling/2007/05/30/lastfm-succumbs-to-the-desire-to-be-a-small-fish-in-a-big-pond/">the CBS thing</a>, and then the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/06/22/lastfm-not-joining-national-day-of-silence/">non-silence on the Day of Silence</a>  (although I'll admit that this wasn't quite a black and white issue), and now this have really saddened me. I like to think a community based site would care for its community - I'm finding it more and more difficult to believe that last.fm do.</p>
