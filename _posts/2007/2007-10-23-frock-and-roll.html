<p>I must admit that It bothered me when I read on <a href="http://www.damonandnaomi.com">Damon &amp; Naomi's website</a> that...</p><br />
<blockquote>Naomi has been dressed for this tour by designer Gary Graham. You'll have to follow the band to see all the outfits</blockquote>
<p>...because...well...nothing really looks cooler than jeans and a T-shirt so why bother with fancy frocks?</p>
<p>But Naomi looks great in this picture - and as frocks go I'd have to say that this looks very nice...although accesorizing with <em>that</em> bass guitar makes all the difference! But of course Naomi always looks great.</p></p>
<p>Apologies for the crap title pun!</p><br />
<br clear="all" /></p>
