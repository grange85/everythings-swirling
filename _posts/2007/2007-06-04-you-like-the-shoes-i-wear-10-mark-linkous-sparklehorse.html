I'm annoyed that I managed to forget my camera last night and never got my own pic of Mark's feet so I was relieved to find that someone else was kind enough to snap this shot at a previous Shepherds Bush show (Oh how I'd have loved to see him at the Bush Hall). I suspect these are the very same comfortable looking boots he wore last night...<br /><br />
