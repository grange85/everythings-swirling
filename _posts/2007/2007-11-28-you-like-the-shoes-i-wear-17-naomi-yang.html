<div>
<p>This is Naomi's second appearance in this series, and second time wearing boots although these cool buckle-y boots are a little cooler than <a href="http://blog.fullofwishes.co.uk/2007/05/09/rock-and-roll-feet-2-naomi-yang-of-damon-naomi/">last times wellies</a>...</p>
<p>The photo was taken at Sunday's very wonderful Damon & Naomi show in London which you can <a href="http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2007/11/26/review-damon-naomi-in-london/">read about on A Head Full of Wishes</a>, and see <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/sets/72157603296888181/">pictures of on Flickr</a>.</p>
<p>#17: <a href="http://www.damonandnaomi.com">Naomi Yang</a> in some cool and comfortable looking buckled boots</p><br />
