<p>...in no particular order...</p>
<p><strong>Low - If You Were Born Today</strong><br />
I remember sitting my car in a supermarket car park unable to move while this song was on the radio when it first came out on a 7" single. It is just stunningly moving - even for an atheist! Low's Christmas album is one of very few seasonal records that could get pulled out at any time fo year...it was a toss up between this and Blue Christmas as to what made it on the list.</p>
<p><strong>The Waitresses - Christmas Wrapping</strong><br />
I still can't quite figure out why I enjoy this one so much. Maybe the silly/sweet cranberry ending - but it always fills me with festive spirit.</p>
<p><strong>The Fountains of Wayne - I Want and Alien for Christmas</strong><br />
Just because...well...who wouldn't.</p>
<p><strong>The Ronettes - Sleigh Ride</strong><br />
"A Christmas Gift for You" is our traditional xmas morning soundtrack - I never get bored of it, and the Ronettes take on Sleigh Ride is the best track on an album full of absolute gems.</p>
<p><strong>Slade - Merry Xmas Everybody</strong><br />
I guess most everyone else in the world is bored sick of this one - but xmas hasn't really arrived until I've heard Noddy telling me that it has.</p>
<p><strong>Brenda Lee - Rocking Around The Christmas Tree</strong><br />
The best Rock 'n' Roll xmas song</p>
<p>Galaxie 500 listers may be surprised at the lack of Simply Having a Wonderful Christmas Time given my annual vociferous defence of McCartney's sugary xmas treat - I love it but would still have to say it's a far cry from any of the above...</p>
