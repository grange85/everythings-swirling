<div class="imagebox-a"><img id="image256" src="http://media.grange85.co.uk/swirling/uploads/2007/07/alien24.jpg" alt="Cute Alien" /></div>John Hurt lies writhing on the table - held down by his shipmates and with his chest/stomach moving in a very scary way - suddenly with a vile splatter of blood this cute little alien shoves its way out of his innards - looks around gives a little squeal of delight and belts kermit-like across the room. Tale away the blood and the screaming and throw in some coloured fur, a pig and a Swedish chef and we'd have Saturday teatime viewing.</p>
