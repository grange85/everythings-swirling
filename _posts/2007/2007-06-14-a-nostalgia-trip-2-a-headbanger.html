There are undoubtedly better pictures of me as a Motorhead fan but this is the only evidence currently in my Flickr photostream. It's a picture of me and my mum probably in 1980 or 81. The sleeveless denim jacket was (eventually) covered in patches (pretty much nothing but Motorhead patches). It's up in the loft somewhere - I probably won't pull it out to wear on Saturday...</p>
<p>...oh...and all that lovely hair :(<br />
<br clear="all" /></p>
