<p>Six months ago <a href="http://blog.fullofwishes.co.uk/2007/06/05/it-wasnt-supposed-to-happen-so-quickly/">my last.fm subscription ran out</a> just after they had stopped being a feisty London-based indie start-up and jumped into the pocket of media giant CBS. My concerns then had a lot to do with the rather depressing thought that nobody seems to want to try and make a go of it on their own - that every start-ups ambition is nothing more than to be hoovered into one of the Internet conglomerates - it's all still true and still rather depressing...[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Google_acquisitions" title="Google acquisitions">1</a>] [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acquisitions_by_Yahoo%21" title="Yahoo! acquisitions">2</a>] [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebay#Acquisitions_and_investments" title="Ebay acquisitions">3</a>] etc.</p>
<p>But despite that I bought myself a xmas pressie of a 12 month sub to last.fm not because I missed being a subscriber after all the <a href="http://www.last.fm/subscribe/">benefits of subscription</a> are pretty minor...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No ads</strong> - I <a href="http://adblockplus.org/en/">haven't seen an ad</a> on last.fm in the six months I've been unsubscribed thanks to Adblock</li>
<li><strong>Personalised radio</strong> - While I'm more inclined to listen to last.fm radio than almost any other radio station I've been happy enough with the limited access I've had for free.</li>
<li><strong>Who&rsquo;s visiting?</strong> is a nice little bonus but hardly a clincher especially given that almost no one vistis my profile...</li>
<li><strong>Red carpet treatment</strong> (priority server access) - I can't say I've ever really noticed any server access problems enough to make me dig in my pocket to improve things</li>
<li><strong>Top secret beta access</strong> - I think I can manage without bleeding edge perks.</li></ul>
<p>No...the reason I subscribed is because last.fm is good and, like Flickr, ultimately I'm happy to put a few quid in the coffers of something that I really like.</p>
<p>And despite what <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/Russ">Russ from last.fm</a> said in a <a href="http://blog.fullofwishes.co.uk/2007/06/05/it-wasnt-supposed-to-happen-so-quickly/#comment-153">comment to my post six months ago</a>...</p><br />
<blockquote>We want people to subscribe because of the features, not because they feel like they&rsquo;re doing us a favour anyway</blockquote>
<p>...I'm afraid that, while it may not be a "favour", its closer to that than to anything else.</p>
<p>Along with <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/grange85/">Flickr</a> and Google (mail, reader, search etc.) last.fm is one of the very few sites that I visit every day - and that's why I got the urge to come back into the last.fm fold...</p></p>
