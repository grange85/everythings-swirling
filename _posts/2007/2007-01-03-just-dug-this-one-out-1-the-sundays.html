<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading%2C_Writing%2C_and_Arithmetic">Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sundays">The Sundays</a> is a cracking album that just makes me feel so warm every time I pull it out (which is not often enough). Listening to it right now it sounds a little dated but those jangly Smiths-y (yawn) guitars and Harriet's voice just makes me very nostalgic for the late 80s and early 90s when discovering music was so exciting (it still is but in a different way - the Internet has made discovering music a lot less challenging!). Their second album "Blind" was forgettable and until I checked Wikipedia I didn't even know there was a third! I think just one perfect Sundays album is all I need.</p>
<p>Of course my enduring memory of The Sundays is that they are responsible for me seeing <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/galaxie/">Galaxie 500</a> one less time than I should have done when they postponed their London show (with G500 supporting) - the rescheduled gig was great but no Galaxie 500!</p>
