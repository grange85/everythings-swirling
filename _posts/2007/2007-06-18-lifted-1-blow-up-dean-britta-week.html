<p><strong>Dean & Britta week</strong></p></p>
<p>I'm pretty sure that all the promo pictures for Back Numbers have been <em>inspired</em> by similar photos from the past - the only one I recognise for certain is this one from Antonioni's (over-rated) style (and precious little else) flick <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060176/">Blow Up</a></p></p>

<p>If anyone recognises any of the others (there're quite a few sprayed over <a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com">Dean & Britta's web site</a>) I'd love to know...</p></p>
