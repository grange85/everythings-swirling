<p>There was a Far Side cartoon from way back when showing parents reading a newspaper where all the ads for jobs were along the lines of "Expert Super Mario player required, 23k plus benefits".</p>
<p>As a parent now I do genuinely dream that the many hours Adam spends playing World of Warcraft will prepare him well for the future and news stories such as <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7030234.stm">this one</a> are a reassurance...</p>
<blockquote><p>The formidable organisational skills needed to run a game team or guild, organise raids involving perhaps 40 people and co-ordinate their different abilities to defeat a game's strongest foes are all relevant to work.</blockquote>
<p>I'm not convinced that the many many hours of text adventures prepared me for anything...</p>
<p>I wish I could find that Larson cartoon online but he <a href="http://www.chillingeffects.org/dmca512/notice.cgi?NoticeID=7227">threatens</a> (albeit so sweetly) anyone who posts his cartoons on websites - silly man.</p></p>
