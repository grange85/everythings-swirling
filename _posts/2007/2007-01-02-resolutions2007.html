<ul>
<li>Lose weight (yawn) so I can fit into a Galaxie 500 T shirt.</li>
<li>Work much harder at my piano practice and music theory.</li>
<li>Read more - and not just comics...<em>proper</em> books as well!</li>
<li>Go to bed earlier - over 2006 it went from being just after midnight to close to 2am!</li>
<li>Write more - NaNoWriMo was an interesting experiment but I need to keep writing because it needs to get MUCH better!</li>
<li>Improve myself - I need to find myself a "direction".</li>
<li>Not to buy a record on a major label - maybe childish petulance but I don't see why I should throw my money at the big four when there is so much really great indie music around.</li>
<li>Get better at blogging - 2006 was an improvement but I still could get better!</ul><br />
