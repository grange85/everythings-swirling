<p>I ordered a bunch of stuff from <a href="http://www.toopure.com/">Too Pure</a> last week...the new <a href="http://www.scoutniblett.com/">Scout Niblett</a>, a <a href="http://toopure.bigcartel.com/product/tim-gane-sean-ohagan-la-vie-dartiste">Tim Gane/Sean O'Hagan soundtrack album</a> I knew nothing about and (finally) the latest (<a href="http://www.toopure.com/electrelane/news.html?read=electrelane-anno-1">and sadly last</a>) <a href="http://www.electrelane.com">Electrelane</a> album - the package arrived yesterday with all the CDs and kicking around in the bottom of the Jiffy was a handful of stickers and badges (and an Electrelane patch!) None of the albums I've downloaded from eMusic over the last year have come with any goodies like this and it's certainly something I'll miss when CDs finally go the way of the dodo.</p>
<p>I have only listened to <a href="http://www.toopure.com/scoutniblett/discography.html">The Fool Can Die Now</a> once but it is going to be in the best of lists (well mine at least) come the end of the year. The duets with Will Oldham work so beautifully.</p><object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/0uDlvl7jNn8&rel=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/0uDlvl7jNn8&rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></p>
