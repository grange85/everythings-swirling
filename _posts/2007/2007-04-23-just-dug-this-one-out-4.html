<br /><br />
I can't remember how this one came into my posession - I guess I was recommended it on the <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/galaxie/mailingl.php">Galaxie 500 Mailing List</a> - I looked through my (sadly incomplete) mailing list archives but all I could find was this from December 1999...<br /><br />
<span class="quote">Over the last few weeks I've been listening to an awful lot of albums that I haven't listened to for a while, some even forgotten (and some rightfully forgotten - - step forward <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Grenadine" class="bbcode_artist">Grenadine</a>!).</span><br /><br />
I'm pretty much certain that I haven't listened to it since then and I suspect that, if anything, it sounds worse now than it did then. But somewhere in the back of my head there's this nagging concern that, for a short period of time, I actually liked this album - it was probably because of a slight fondness for <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Unrest" class="bbcode_artist">Unrest</a>. But listening to it now it makes my toes curl. Whether it's the olde-time laughably smug croon of "<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Grenadine/_/Hell+Over+Hickory+Dew" class="bbcode_track">Grenadine - Hell Over Hickory Dew</a>" or the tiresome vocoder (?) cover of "<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Grenadine/_/This+Girl%27s+in+Love+With+You" class="bbcode_track">Grenadine - This Girl's in Love With You</a>". But picking out those two memorably bad tracks just exposes how unmemorable the rest of the album is.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I've bought some pretty woeful albums in my time but suspect that this one is one of the worst. It will be (at least) another seven and a half years before I dig this one out again...<br /><br />
