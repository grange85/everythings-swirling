After <a href="http://blog.fullofwishes.co.uk/swirling/2007/05/10/rock-and-roll-feet-4-bjork/">Bjorks silly shoes</a> I thought I'd pick someone wearing something very sensible...so I turned to Aimee Mann - every picture I've ever seen (well the ones on Flickr anyway) has her wearing <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pinkbeltrage/54322863/">jeans and flat shoes</a> - it's what she wears...all the time or so I thought...<br />
<br/><br />
<br /><br />
