<p>In my younger days of three or four gigs a week and taking a chance on anything, it might be that just occasionally two gigs of interest might turn up on the same day. But now I'm older and parenting and old-age and laziness mean that I make only a couple of gigs a month (at the <em>very</em> most) two gigs that I really want to see clashing is just an outrage.</p>
<p>Next month on the same night as I have tickets to see <a href="http://www.decemberists.com">The Decemberists</a> at the Shepherds Bush Empire, <a href="http://fat-cat.co.uk/fatcat/artistInfo.php?id=108">Nina Nastasia</a> is playing a few hundred yards away at The Bush Hall. If I had a choice between the two I'd have picked Nina Nastasia, particularly as The Bush Hall is a much nicer venue. But I already have tickets and am taking Adam to The Decemberists so I guess I'm tied to that.</p>
<p>I'm sure I'll enjoy The Decemberists just fine (they've been great all of the three or four times I've seen them before) but really...</p><br />
