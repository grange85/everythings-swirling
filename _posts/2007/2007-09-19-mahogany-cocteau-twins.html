<p>David's <a href="http://www.musicarcades.com">Music Arcades</a> blog recently dug out <a href="http://www.musicarcades.com/2007/09/cocteau-twins-v.html">Victorialand by The Cocteau Twins</a> and I thought about how long it had been since I listened to any Cocteau Twins and thought that maybe I should dig out Victorialand or Treasure or even Blue Bell Knoll...then the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/mahoganyinthecity">Mahogany</a> album I ordered from <a href="http://www.trackandfield.org.uk/">Track and Field</a> arrived...and suddenly I didn't need to...Mahogany most definitely &hearts; The Cocteau Twins. The album is great, and comes with a bonus disc of remixes including one by Robin Guthrie as if they needed to reinforce their love.</p>
<p>This is probably as far from the Cocteaus as they stray...and that's not too far...</p>
