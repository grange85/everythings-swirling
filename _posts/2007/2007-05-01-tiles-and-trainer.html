This is one of the photos I took with an Easter egg box for <a href="http://www.pinholeday.org/">Worldwide Pinhole Day</a> last Sunday - all were a little underexposed and needed plenty of time in some very old developer to get any sort of image out of them. Adam was grumpy at this point and refused to keep still so he was never going to be anything but a blur anyway!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
There are a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/grange85/tags/wwpd2007/">couple more of my photos on Flickr</a> and a <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/wpd/pool/">Flickr group</a> showing other peoples better efforts.<br />
<br clear="all" /></p>
