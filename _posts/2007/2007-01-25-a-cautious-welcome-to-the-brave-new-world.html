<p>I made a post four months ago to the <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/galaxie/index.php?article_id=125">Galaxie 500 Mailing List</a> (I thought I posted it here as well but I guess not) about the dilemma of downloading music rather than buying CDs.</p><br />
<blockquote>I've always bought records and CDs - I see it as a physical representation of an arrangement between myself and the music I love. It is something that you can see and touch and smell and that says - I LIKE THIS or I LOVE THIS or THIS MOVES ME.<br/><br/>BUT I also love digital audio files - there's less (NO) environmental impact that the  manufacturing process of a CD entails - no little plastic disc that will fill up a landfill for thousands of years, no transportation, no politics of oil sitting behind it all - it liberates artists from the financial restraints of "making a record".<br/><br/> BUT I object, with a vengeance, to the DRM that most retailers place on the digital files they sell - I object to "leasing" music rather than "owning" it - I object to the way that retailers think of me as a thief. I worry about the quality, I worry about the longevity...<br/><br/>My head tells me go digital - there is too much that is bad about the manufacturing process - but my heart tells me that I want something I can hold...</blockquote>
<p>Shortly afterwards I signed up to (DRM free) download site <a href="http://www.emusic.com">eMusic</a> and dipped my toes into the new era with mixed results. eMusic makes it so much easier to embrace this new era although I still had problems. One of the albums I downloaded was <a href="http://www.fromamouth.com/milkymoon/">Joanna Newsom</a>'s awesome album Ys - and within days I'd bought myself the CD of it - for something that beautiful it didn't seem right not having a physical object to support my love (or <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/hazel/2006/12/31/peonies-nod-in-the-breeze-and-while-they-wetly-bow-with-hydrocephalitic-listlessness-ants-mop-up-a-their-brow/">infatuation as Hazel seems to think it is</a>!). Downloading still seems such a non-committal form of music love. I've "bought" other albums through eMusic and for most I'm quite happy with the not "owning", but for music I really LOVE I need to go all the way!</p>
<p>Yesterday I "bought" the new <a href="http://www.decemberists.com">Decemberists</a> album from iTunes (technically it's on <a href="http://www.roughtraderecords.com/">Rough Trade</a> over here so I didn't break my <a href="http://blog.fullofwishes.co.uk/swirling/2007/01/02/resolutions2007/">new years resolution</a> to not buy major label records!) and in this instance I feel fine with not "owning" it (and I own this less than most because of the evils of DRM that iTunes music has), maybe because it's just a little too polished for me to truly love it. </p>
<p>After nearly four months of a more committed relationship with downloading it seems that I might be able to get on with it - with exceptions for the truly exceptional.</p><br />
