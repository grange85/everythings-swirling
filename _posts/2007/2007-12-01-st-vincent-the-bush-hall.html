<p>We saw a stunning set by <a href="http://www.ilovestvincent.com/">St Vincent</a> last night at the Bush Hall. There's something a little incongruous about the frail young thing on stage in her cocktail dress and dainty shoes playing her guitar so emphatically. Occasionally she was sweet and sometimes possessed and sometimes both in the same song. High point was the stunningly sweet encore cover of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/These_Days_%28Jackson_Browne_song%29">These Days</a>...but it somehow seems wrong to choose that as the high point when it was the "possessed" bits (such as <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/grange85/2076268835/in/set-72157603338829214/">going at her guitar with a plastic limb</a>) that will stick in my head.</p><br />
