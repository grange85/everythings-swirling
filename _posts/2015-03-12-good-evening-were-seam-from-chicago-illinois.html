<p>... we're gonna play some songs for you... this first one's called Decatur</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/16610052888" title="The rather brilliant Headsparks LP by Seam #seam #headsparks #lp #notahfow by Andy Aldridge, on Flickr"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7596/16610052888_b9ce19e6f0_z.jpg" width="640" height="640" alt="The rather brilliant Headsparks LP by Seam #seam #headsparks #lp #notahfow"></a></p>
<p>This is a recording I made of Seam when they were over in London in 1992. They supported Yo La Tengo at The Borderline. I'd been listening to the brilliant Headsparks all week but didn't realise they were on the bill until we arrived at the venue. A short but splendid set. </p>
<p>The evening still rates as one of my favourites. Seam were a brilliant treat and this was my first Yo La Tengo show, around the time of May I Sing With Me, and was also sensational.</p>
