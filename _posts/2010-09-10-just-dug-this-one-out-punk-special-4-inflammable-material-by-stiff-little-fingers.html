<div><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammable_Material">Inflammable Material by Stiff Little Fingers</a>
<p />Never got into SLF at the time - not too sure why. I remember seeing them at the Guildford Civic Hall but reckon that was early 80s rather than later 70s so I can&#39;t blame that rather disappointing gig for my negligence. And negligent it surely was because this is mostly a gem. Not as consistently good as The Damned, and not as scarily powerful as The Ruts - but a classic that I feel sad for having ignored. Love also that the fab <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Thompson">Mayo Thompson</a> produced it.<br />
