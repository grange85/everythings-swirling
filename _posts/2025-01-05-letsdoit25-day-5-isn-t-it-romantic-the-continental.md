Today a couple of selections that are grand ensemble pieces from films so not so easy to put in the artist - but I've given a shot at it...

### Day 5 / Song #1<br/>Isn't it Romantic - Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald (1932)
I'm picking the whole 6 minute plus sequence from the fantastic _Love Me Tonight_ which starts with the tailor Chevalier whistling and singing it to his customer who hums it as he leaves, is then overheard by a taxi driver and his composer fare. The composer continues to work on his composition with a trainload of soldiers who the then sing it while marching through the countryside. They pass a gypsy violinist who later plays it at a gypsy fireside where it is overheard by Jeanette MacDonald who finishes it off. Perfection!

### Day 5 / Song #2<br>The Continental - Erik Rhodes / Lillian Miles (1934)
... and for this, the full 12 minute sequence which can't so easily be described but... just watch! It's utterly breathtaking!
