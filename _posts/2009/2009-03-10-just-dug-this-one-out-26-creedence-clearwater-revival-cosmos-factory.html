<div class="imagebox-a"><a title="Creedence Clearwater Revival - Cosmo's Factory - 1970-1, by khiltscher" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/khiltscher/3141651772/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3216/3141651772_1c5ddb4d44_m.jpg"></a></div>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creedence_Clearwater_Revival">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a> were one of the many bands that my Dad passed onto me. We had a couple of albums kicking around (Willy & The Poor Boys and maybe Green River) but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmo%27s_Factory">Cosmo's Factory</a> is the album that stuck in my head, possibly because of Travelin' Band and Up Around the Bend, a couple of songs I have fond memories of. So this was the album I grabbed this morning when I thought a blog post was long overdue.</p>
<p>I've just made my way through it but it was bloody hard going - an album full of charmless, stodgy, chunky dross with very little clue as to what I may have liked about it. Fogerty's voice grates and the majority of the album stinks to high heaven. The side two centrepiece of an eleven minute version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Heard_It_Through_the_Grapevine">I Heard It Through the Grapevine</a> was shameful. I shall never listen to this again.</p></p>
