<p>I was pretty late to the Julie Doiron love only discovering her greatness with Goodnight Nobody. Snow Falls in November makes me swoon. I Can Wonder... will b e back when I start talking albums of the year. Great gig this year too at The Luminaire.</p>

<p>Nina Nastasia released five albums in the decade, all of which should be here, every one is a beautiful gem, all different and all unmistakeably Nina. In a more sensible world she'd be a star but I love how she's not because I really think its because she knows it's perfect to be the way she is!</p>
