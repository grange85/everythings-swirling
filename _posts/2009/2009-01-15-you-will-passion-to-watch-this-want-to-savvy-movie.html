<p>I have a Google blog search set up to track down bloggers posting about Luna, unfortunately most of what it catches are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splog">splogs</a> - which should piss me off but they make me smile so I can't really hate them too much! Here's a selection of my faves. Note...</p>
<ul>
<li>the constant use of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1056686/bio">Lee Wall (II)</a> which clearly shows that <a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a> has been raided for film names.</li>
<li>the mis-use of "passion" in the last one that <a href="http://www.answers.com/love#Thesaurus">suggests that a thesaurus has been used</a> for variety.</li>
<li>the spelling throughout that proves that the spammers didn't bother using a dictionary.</li></ul><br />
<blockquote>
