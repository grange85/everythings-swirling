<p>Everything I wrote <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2004/05/17/108850964871637052/">when I reached 40</a> still applies - I don't feel older, maybe a bit more lethargic... or comfortable... but still happy.</p>
<p>Adam bought me an Xbox game that he's not allowed to play (Left4Dead), Hazel bought me a couple of lovely prints from Etsy. Elaine & Kiek got me a couple of good looking books. Breakfast was Hot + Buns and chocolate fridge cake. Off for a curry later... today I will put on all the weight I've lost in the last six months.</p>
<p>Quite looking forward to 50 now...</p></p>
