<p>Recently in one of those <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2008/12/16/my-top-7albums/">Facebook memes when asked to name my top seven albums</a> I put <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patti_smith">Patti Smith</a>'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horses_(album)">Horses</a> on that list. Obviously lists like that change like the weather but it is a great album and fully deserving of a place on the rotating list of great albums that appear in my top <em>n</em> lists whenever I do them. Until last night I had never seen Patti Smith live, it was just one of those things I knew I needed to do but never actually got around to.</p>
<p>Last night she played at the Royal Festival Hall as part of <a href="http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/festivals-series/meltdown">Ornette Coleman's Meltdown</a> and provided me with a rollercoaster ride that left me in turns frustrated and breathless... and if pushed to rank it on a scale of greatness it would fall comfortably in the 'pretty damn' section.</p>
<p>She opened by reading <a href="http://www.oceanstar.com/patti/lyrics/pissfact.htm">Piss Factory</a>, maybe she opens every show with it... if she doesn't, she should, Patti's delivery just sucked the audience in. She then went on to perform a mix of songs and poetry with various guest musicians including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flea_(musician)">Flea from the Red Hot Chilli Peppers</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Utley">Adrian Utley from Portishead</a>, her daughter Jesse and <a href="http://www.joujouka.net/">The Master Musicians of JouJouka</a> (who the rest of the crowd adored but who set my teeth on edge with their horrid screechy pipes).</p>
<p>However it was when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_mt_zion">Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra</a> provided backing that the evening pushed relentlessy on into that 'pretty damn great' slot. Before the encore <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornette_Coleman">Ornette Coleman</a> walked slowly to center stage, muttered some generic platitudes and walked slowly offstage - a bit more involvement from him would have been nice. Patti is a phenomenal woman with more charisma and energy than I could ever dream of having. I'm relieved to have ticked off another great in <a href="http://www.songkick.com/users/grange85">my gigography</a>. And, even though she didn't play any of Horses, I'd go again.</p></p>
