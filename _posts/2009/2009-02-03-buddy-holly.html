<p>Today is 50 years since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_the_Music_Died">Buddy died in that plane crash</a> and given that I'm not yet 50 obviously his death wasn't really something that had any sort of impact on me...but his music did. I grew up with a lot of Buddy Holly, my dad had a pile of original albums (that I think he acquired from his brother and that are now in my posession/shed). There was a period in the mid 70s where me and school friend Dave would spend an awful lot of our breaks talking about Rock 'n' Roll. I remember we smuggled a cassette player in on one school sports day and sat on the field listening to some great music during the events we weren't required to be a part of.</p>
<p>Dave, Greg and myself met up in Woking to go and see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buddy_Holly_Story">The Buddy Holly Story</a> and then got chased around the streets of Woking by some hooligans - <del datetime="2009-02-05T12:28:06+00:00">They</del><ins datetime="2009-02-05T12:28:06+00:00">Dave and Greg</ins> lived in Woking so I dived on a train at the station and they probably got chased home. I enjoyed the film if not the after film entertainment.</p><br />
