<p>These questions concern our universal experiences with music, how we&rsquo;re exposed to it and our reactions. It&rsquo;s not about how much you know or your tastes now in music (we can see that already in FB). Answer the questions or not, tag your friends or not. LOL at some of your answers.</p>

<li><strong>What music did your parents listen to when you were a child?</strong><br />

Dad = Trad jazz, rock and roll - pretty much anything!<br />
<strong>Impressions then?</strong>; I hated most of what my mum listened to and spent a lot of time trying to turn her onto better things. Dad's hoarding of music had a huge influence on me.<br />

<li><strong>Have you ever sung the words to a song aloud and then found out you had the words wrong? What was it?</strong> - Yes - most recently discovering that Nick Drake never held an ocean in the palm of his hand.</li>
<li><strong>What music do you wish you knew more about?</strong> - Almost everything.</li>
<li><strong>What is your most memorable music experience?</strong> - Meeting (and liking) all three members of Galaxie 500 - maybe the <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/grange85/journal/2007/07/20/ilc_my_top_6...dean_wareham_moments...">arse-print incident</a></li>
<li><strong>What was your High School or College fight song?</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367279/quotes"><del datetime="2009-03-05T10:45:06+00:00">I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it</del><ins datetime="2009-03-05T10:45:06+00:00"> I don't know what that is nor do I care to find out.
