I think I'll make it a tradition to post about <a href="http://www.thenewyear.net/">The New Year</a> every new year. Bradley's Almanac has a <a href="http://www.bradleysalmanac.com/2006/12/mp3s-touch-and-gos-25th-day-two.htm">couple of songs to download</a> from their performance at The Touch and Go festival earlier this year.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I think album #3 is LONG LONG overdue - and another trip to London is in order!</p>
<p>Lots of other good stuff to listen to on <a href="http://www.bradleysalmanac.com/blogger.html">Bradley's Almanac</a> including, if you scroll down <a href="http://www.bradleysalmanac.com/2006/12/mp3s-touch-and-gos-25th-day-three.htm"> this page</a> a bit, <a href="http://www.tarajaneoneil.com/">Tara Jane O'Neil</a> and <a href="http://">Chris Brokaw</a> together and <a href="http://www.touchandgorecords.com/bands/band.php?id=67">Seam</a> (reunited)!<br />
