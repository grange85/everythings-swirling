_Teenage Rampage - The Sweet (1974)_  
The Sweet would absolutely rule the "Top 50 songs if you only listen to the first 10 seconds"
 - "We want Sweet! We want Sweet!" at the beginning of Teenage Rampage.
 - The sirens at the start of Blockbuster.
 - "Are you ready Steve?.. Andy?.. Mick? All right fellas, let's go!" at the start of Ballroom Blitz.
 - "Look out!" and the roll of thunder at the start of Hell Raiser.
 - The manic laugh at the beginning of Action.
