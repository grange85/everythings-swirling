<p>I'm sure as this project goes on I'll resort to endless snarky comments at the clothes the cast are wearing, but for my first foray into sneering I've decided to pick up on Cordy and her friend's horrific hair. I actually do remember my sister and her friends getting their hands on a crimper once so know that while this looks ridiculous, it is strangely believable... sadly the screen caps don't really show the true horror...</p><br />

<p>But Willow looks unbearably cute in plaits so all is forgiven...</p><br />
