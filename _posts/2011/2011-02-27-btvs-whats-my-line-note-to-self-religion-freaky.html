<p>I'm sorry but religion is freaky, and the more I think about it the freakier it seems. I try to deal with it because there're so many religious people out there and I feel I ought to respect their views... there are even people I like... a lot... who believe in all this mumbo-jumbo - but if ever I start to think about it...<shudder></p>
<p>Anyway... What's My Line is a pretty cool double header here are some thoughts...</p>
<ul>
<li>I know I'll say it every time but Oz = coolest</li>
<li>I like Kendra - she makes me smile</li>
<li>Careers Fair? What's that all about? Do you really tell kids what they might want to be based on multi-choice questions - it happened in The Simpsons too!?</li>
<li>"I was only gone for a minute"</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p> I <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2011/01/21/btvs-angel-just-do-it-for-goodness-sakes/">resisted last time</a> but now it's getting silly - it would have taken five minutes to poke around in the rubble and pop stake through Dru and Spike's chests - but no, let's just assume they're dead...</p>
<p><strong>Rules of Buffy # 2</strong>:  If you get an opportunity to despatch a particularly nasty demon... don't, it'll probably work out fine</p>
<p>Anyway here's some freaky religious folk making beautiful music...</p>
