<p>In Welcome to the Hellmouth Buffy effortlessly leaps the school gates... sadly the non-fighting superhero bit of Buffy often gets forgotten... but just occasionally it gets an outing and it does in Lie To Me when Buffy leaps from the floor of the basement to get hold of Drusilla.</p>
<p>Sadly no decent screencap so this'll have to do...</p>

<p>Ford probably fits into <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2011/01/15/btvs-the-pack-rip-principal-flutie/">Rules of Buffy #1</a> although it's debatable whether he is "extremely nice" but as he turns out to be not only a (kind of) demon but also dead at the end, I'm going to put him in...</p>
<p><em>Rules of Buffy # 1: If you&rsquo;re an extremely nice minor character in Buffy then you&rsquo;re either a demon or about to die at the hands (or claws, teeth, pincers) of a demon.</em></p>
