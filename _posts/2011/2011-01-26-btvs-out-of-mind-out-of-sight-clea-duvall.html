<p>Well she may have been invisible for most of the episode but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clea_DuVall">Clea Duvall</a> made an impact. A memorable face, and a wonderfully sad display of loneliness...</p><br />

<p>...but really it probably wasn't enough to get her a post of her own - nor was her memorable turn in the early episodes of promising but ultimately rubbish series Heroes... nope - she gets a spot of her own because of her spellbinding performance as the fortune teller Sofie in the very, very wonderful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carniv%C3%A0le">Carnivale</a>.</p><br />
