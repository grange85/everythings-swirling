<p>So... yesterday I discovered that the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGsmvC3px6o">Lush track Hey Hey Helen</a> isn't a Lush track after all but is in fact a cover of an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPbbiUcCH2Y">Abba b-side</a>. Now I don't really have a problem with Abba's music, my problem with Abba is the perception that they were more than that, that they were somehow the saviours of pop - that they were special when pop needed special.</p>
<p>They really weren't... they were a band that made pop music - some of it fine, some of it average, and some of it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FxUeEBU6zY">pretty dire</a>... but lots of bands have done that... even some bands I loved... but I'd not dare to suggest they were anything more than what they were.</p>
