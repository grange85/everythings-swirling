<p>OK... I know the Oz = Cool thing is getting a bit boring (and doesn't really need to be said any more) but this is an Oz episode, this is where Oz gets to be who he really is - he mutilates animals and attempts to kill Willow and at the end we love him even more... A great episode... possibly my favourite so far - I know I'm probably alone in that but... you know... Oz!</p><br />
