<h3>Update 2024-01-19</h3>
_Since this is far and away the most popular post on my blog I thought it warranted an update. Mostly prompted by **H W** who emailed me some suggestions and then I saw that the post was filled with broken links and images. I removed comments from the blog ages ago because of the amount of spam but feel free [get in touch](/about/) if you think there are any glaring omissions!_

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk/479124298/" title="Siren"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/1/194/479124298_3be127716c_b.jpg" alt="Siren"></a>

I was absolutely sure there were tons of songs with sirens at the beginning so I thought that was ripe for a playlist - while that may be true, tracking them down turned out to be tricky but I managed to rustle up enough (with help!) for a "my top 6" post.

First up obviously (well it was obvious to me)...
