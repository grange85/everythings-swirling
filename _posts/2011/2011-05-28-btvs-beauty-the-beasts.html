<p>Buffy sees a counselor/psychologist - he seems nice (which is I think quite rare for a smoker on TV)... so obviously he succumbs to <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2011/01/15/btvs-the-pack-rip-principal-flutie/">Rule of Buffy #1</a>.</p>
<p>After all my <em>Oz is cool</em> posts it is worth mentioning that he does look rather silly in werewolf-mode.</p>
<p>And there's Faith... oh Faith. <a href="http://www.screencap-paradise.com/caps/albums/Series/Buffy/Buf_S3/Buf_304beasts/beasts194.jpg">She rocks, she rolls</a> and she's here to punch Buffy's lights out... accidentally this time...</p>

<p>Hmm... those last two paras may suggest that my allegiances are changing.</p>
