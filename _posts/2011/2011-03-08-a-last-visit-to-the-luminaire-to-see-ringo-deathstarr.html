<p>So it's all over, <a class="flower_imagebox" href="http://media.grange85.co.uk/swirling/uploads/2011/03/POROOF1.jpg">the best venue in London</a> is no more. Last night, despite feeling a bit crappy I headed off for one last visit. First up were <a href="http://www.spceco.com/">SPC ECO</a> (pronounced Space Echo), first up clearly because it was probably already past guitarist Harry's bedtime. Good noises... and discovering that bassist/programmer was Dean Garcia, formerly of Curve, was not a surprise... and that guitarist Harry is his son was also not a surprise.</p><br />

<p>Next up <a href="http://www.clubac30.com/artist.php?AID=ACA2C23D5C56F23B190E2E0904DAA6C5">Ringo Deathstarr</a>... they make me feel simultaneously young and old, they make noise, lots of it, but you can't shrug them off as just that, they're shared boy/girl vocals; they're the way that Elliott works his guitar; they're the way that the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/5507930296/in/set-72157626094257661/">kick drum reaches my inside</a>s. Mostly it's young they make me feel. The album Colour Trip is worth checking out.</p><br />

<p>I've never <em>got</em>, headliner, Piano Magic, and the thought of the growing up that was required to enjoy their set just wasn't something that appealed - that and the aforementioned crappiness - so as Ringo Deathstarr left the stage I left The Luminaire, for the last time.</p><br />
