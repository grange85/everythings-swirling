<p>Today is a beautiful day... but mostly I'm stuck at work. I just sat in the garden over lunch and listened to The Comforts of Madness by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Saints">Pale Saints</a> - an album that takes me away from where I am and puts me in a much better place. Like many I suspect my first introduction to Pale Saints was on SnubTV.</p>

<p>I saw them a few times including one last time at the ICA after Ian had left... they were still not bad (although arguably not Pale Saints).</p>
