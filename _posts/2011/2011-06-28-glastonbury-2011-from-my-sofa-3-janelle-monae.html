<p>... me and everyone else in the country it seems was blown away by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/festivals/glastonbury/2011/artists/janellemonae/">Janelle Mon&aacute;e's Glastonbury performance</a>. My first exposure to Ms Monae was listening to <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/soundcheck/2010/jul/26/">this podcast</a> while driving through France last August - Hazel bought <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ArchAndroid_%28Suites_II_and_III%29">the record</a> on our return and it's a gem... but even that wasn't as great as this fun packed performance...</p>
