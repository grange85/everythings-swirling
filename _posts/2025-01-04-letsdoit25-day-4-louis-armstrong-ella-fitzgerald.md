A couple of songs without any cinema connection, so I probably don't have too much to say - but... it's Louis and Ella so nothing really needs to be said I guess - either may yet make another appearance! 

### Day 4 / Song #1<br/>Louis Armstrong with Sy Oliver and his Orchestra - La vie en rose (1950)
It seems odd to pick Piaf yesterday singing a translation of Jezebel and then have Louis today singing a translation of Piaf's signature song. But I love Armstrong's trumpet on this and, of couse, that voice.

### Day 4 / Song #2<br/>Ella Fitzgerald and Delta Rhythm Boys - It's Only a Paper Moon (1945)
Of course, there is a cinema connection for Paper Moon, but I didn't pick the [Paul Whiteman/Peggy Healy version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbB4Qgw6jZw) used in the [1973 film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Moon_(film))... although I could have done quite easily! But Ella's version is better.
