### I was worried that Hitchcock's last early British film might see him going it out with a whimper

Coming after two absolute gems in [Young and Innocent]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2018-03-04-hitch-23-young-and-innocent-1937 %}) and [The Lady Vanishes]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2018-08-14-hitch-24-the-lady-vanishes-1938 %}) it's no wonder that it's practically a forgotten Hitch - but it's no whimper. 

It has a fabulous cast:

 - Maureen O'Hara is beautiful and has some fire
 - Charles Laughton can be relied upon to achieve what no other actor has - being effortlessly brilliant in ridiculously over-the-top, hammy roles (there's a fine line between a Laughton and a Blessed!)
 - Leslie Banks is wonderfully villainous and surprisingly effective in his grubbiness 
 - and even Robert Newton has some charm although he's no Donat or [Redgrave]({{site.baseurl}}
{% post_url 2017-08-05-hitch-20-the-39-steps %}) (and to be fair the role isn't written with the charm of a Richard Hannay or Gilbert).

The story is a great one, although it feels a bit rushed in places that makes some of the character's actions seem a bit odd, and the sets and models are nicely convincing - the wreck model sequences are tense and exciting and the murderous wreckers are brilliantly evil.

If anything's lacking it's probably Hitch - this is a standard above-average British film of the 30's - it doesn't have any flashes that set it any higher.

It's a great film - but only an average Hitch.
