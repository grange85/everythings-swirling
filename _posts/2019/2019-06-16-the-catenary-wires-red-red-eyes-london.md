Was at the lovely The Catenary Wires show in London on Firday night. St Pancras Old Church was a perfect setting - it wasn't as well attended as I'd expected but that only made it more special.

Red Red Eyes opened. I had bought and loved their LP Horology last year but hadn't listened to it for a while so it was a treat to catch them here and be reminded to listen to it some more.
