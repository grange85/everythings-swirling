To be honest there are a stack of tracks that _trigger_ NWOBH in my head - but Sanctuary is a pretty fine example.

I first saw Maiden in February 1981 on the Killers tour at The Guildford Civic Hall - I don't remember a great deal but remember being thrilled - and remember chatting to another fan on about the show on the platform of London Road station on the way home.

I only saw them two or three times after this - to be honest I think they lost a bit of what made them special when Paul DiAnno was sacked - although it was pretty much the right decision for the band. I never really got on with Dickinson's voice... also by 1983 NWOBHM was pretty much done for me.
