And so to America, and the big studio resources are clear for all to see on the screen. But Rebecca opens with a lovely model tracking shot through the gates and along the overgrown paths to Manderley - as if Hitch was saying "if you want me Selznick, you get all of me".

To be honest (and this might be clear if you've read [any of the previous posts in this series](/swirling/category/hitchcock/)) that Hitch's model shots are part of what I've loved most about his British era films so it's nice to see he decided not to build a full-size Manderley on the studio backlot.

Hitchcock described Rebecca as being "not a Hitchcock film" but it undoubtedly has Hitchcock's hand and maybe in the wake of the British films and with the hindsight of his American films Rebecca looks like a Hitch film to me.

Joan Fontaine is adorable as the new Mrs de Winter. She plays demure and insecure so beautifully. While I've loved the sassy confidence and give-as-good-as-they-get humour of Pamela ([The 39 Steps]({{site.baseurl}}
{% post_url 2017/2017-08-05-hitch-20-the-39-steps %})), Erica ([Young and Innocent]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2018/2018-03-04-hitch-23-young-and-innocent-1937 %})) and Iris ([The Lady Vanishes]({{site.baseurl}}
{% post_url 2018/2018-08-14-hitch-24-the-lady-vanishes-1938 %})). I think the gaucheness of Joan's Mrs de Winter is played in a way that still allows her to show a different kind of strength.

Olivier is Olivier and as such is believable as the damaged Maxim and the scene where they're watching their honeymoon films is a little heartbreaking to see them so happy in the films and so broken in reality.

Judith Anderson is remarkable as Mrs Danvers, and George Sanders is such a sleaze that you wonder how anyone could want to _liaise_ with him!

But one thing that Hitch might have been right about, and something that maybe does make it a little less Hitchcockian is the lack of humour - it could use a little more light, and while Nigel Bruce and Florence Bates take a pop at lightening things it's not enough.
