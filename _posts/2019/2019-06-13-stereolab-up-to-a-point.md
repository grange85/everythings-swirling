I adore Stereolab... up to a point. And that point is probably the day before they released Dots and Loops. It's my fault we drifted apart, they developed their lounge and I just wanted more motorik.

I saw the band loads of times up until 1997, and just once after in 2004 - [the post I wrote back then](/swirling/2004/08/25/the-only-band-that-can-still-make-me-dance/) could probably be applied to last night's show (except without the trombone) - but I'll write a new one anyway.

I think [this video from last week's Primavera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8q1Gdh1ptQ) show deceived me slightly with it's complete pre-1996-ness.

Last night had flashes of 'lab brilliance and they were Crest (1993), Metronomic Underground (1996), French Disko (1993) and a blinding set-closer Lo Boob Oscillator (1993). But most of the rest of the set was from the albums I was cooler on and had therefore listened to less.

Here's Crest from last night _(apologies for the shakiness of sound and vision)_:

...and the end of Lo Boob Oscillator _(apologies for shooting this in portrait mode - I hadn't intended videoing it at all but ... hypnotized and before I realised it was too late to change!)_:

I think I'd go see a _Stereolab 1993_ tribute band in a shot!

I still love them but I only truly half-loved the show.
