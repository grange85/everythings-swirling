I love Ray Harryhausen and his work but I understand why Clash of the Titans was when he decided to hang up his puppets. In the wake of Star Wars things changed and while a lot of the effects in this film are brilliant their integration into the film seems clumsy by more modern methods - it was time to let the new guys take his work and run with it. 

I'll say however that the fight with Medusa is still better than any CGI we've seen so far!

The leads are charming enough and the supporting cast is amazing, even if they are rather sleepwalking through it. But the story isn't great so Ray's sequences are the real joy of the film.
