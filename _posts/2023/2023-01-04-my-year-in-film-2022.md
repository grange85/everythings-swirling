Another year gone, less films this watched again this year - not too sure why but it's down over 40 from last year, and over 150 from first COVID-year 2020. This year has seen us finally getting back to seeing films on the big screen - thanks mostly to having the lovely [Jam Jar](https://www.jamjarcinema.com/) on our doorstep - and the [Tyneside Cinema](https://tynesidecinema.co.uk/) in the city showing some classics.

**Stats**
- I watched 232 films
- The average score of the films I watched was 5.82 / 10
- I saw 9.5% of them on the big screen
- 46% of the films I watched were from before I was born
- 8 were animated, 8 were westerns and 10 were musicals
- 91.8% of films were in English  
  other langugaes:
   - Bengali (1)
   - French (4)
   - Japanese (4)
   - Malayalam (1)
   - Swedish (2)
   - Silent (8)

The only film I rated 10 was Cléo de 5 à 7 (Agnes Varda, 1962) which we saw at the [Star and Shadow](https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/) - which always gets a 10.

The highest rated films I hadn't seen before all scored 8s and included:
 - Ugetsu Monogatari (Kenji Mizoguchi, 1953)
 - Sanshō Dayū (Kenji Mizoguchi, 1954)  
 _these two Mizoguchi films are on Amazon Freevee - which is free with ads but neither had any ads (for me) - well worth catching_

 - Distant Thunder (Satyajit Ray, 1973)
 - Everything Everywhere All at Once (Dan Kwan / Daniel Scheinert, 2022)
