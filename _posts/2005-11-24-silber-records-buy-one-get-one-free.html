<p>Now I have to admit that I have downloaded and enjoyed a number of <a href="http://www.aarktica.net/">Aarktica</a> tracks over the last few years but, bad boy that I am, I never got around to actually buying anything. Now <a href="http://www.silbermedia.com/">Silber Records</a> are doing a fab <a href="http://www.silbermedia.com/sale/">Buy one get one free</a> deal at their online Paypal driven site and I no longer have an excuse.</p>
<p>Plenty to choose from and the site has stacks of stuff to download so you can try before you buy (including complete albums hosted by the Internet Archive). Have a poke around and you'll find some tracks by the very excellent <a href="http://www.rivulets.net/">Rivulets</a>.</p></p>
