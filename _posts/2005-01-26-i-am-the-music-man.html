<p>I am the music man...</p>
<p>I passed that piano exam I whined about at the end of last year - it wasn't a "good" pass - but it was a pass. Now on to Grade 4. I must admit that while I'm loving playing the piano I find it frustrating that I do more "learning" than "playing" - I'm hoping at some point that will change.</p><br /></p>
