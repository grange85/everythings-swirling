<p>I arrived at the Bush Hall just after eight hoping to catch support act <a href="http://www.myspace.com/veronicafallshard">Veronica Falls</a> whose single track on their MySpace page convinced me to make the effort. In the olden days you'd arrive and hand over your ticket or a fiver and you'd be in but in this new ticketless age each person has to convince the door staff who they are, which makes entry a slower process. A queue had formed outside the venue and when I finally made my way in Veronica Falls were already half-way through a very enjoyable set of noisy and loose guitar pop. I saw enough to want to hear more but as far as I can tell I'll have to make do with that one track on MySpace.</p>
<p>I positioned myself at the front of the stage - possibly a little too far forward for the best sound but by the time I realised this, the crowd behind made it difficult to move back. At least I got a good view if not the best sound.</p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/3894026985/"><img alt="The Pastels & Tenniscoats" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2645/3894026985_6600d2ec59_m.jpg" title="The Pastels & Tenniscoats at The Bush Hall" width="240" height="180" /></a>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pastels">The Pastels</a> had the two members of lovely Japanese pop act <a href="http://eblog.tenniscoats.com/">Tenniscoats</a> playing with them (as well as Gerry Love from Teenage Fanclub on bass). The two bands have a released <a href="http://www.dominorecordco.com/uk/albums/25-06-09/two-sunsets/">a very beautiful album, Two Sunsets</a>, and the set was made up predominantly of tracks from that album.</p>
<p>Main set closer was The Pastels own Baby Honey which was great to hear and rocked beautifully hard. The encore started with Tenniscoats doing a track on their own before The Pastels returned for a couple more... and it was over.</p>
<p>All together a stunning evening and well worth dragging my tired, old bones along to.</p>
