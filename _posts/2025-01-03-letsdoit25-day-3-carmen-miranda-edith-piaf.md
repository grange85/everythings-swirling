1. Carmen Miranda - South American Way (from the 1940 film [Down Argentine Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_Argentine_Way))
2. Edith Piaf - Jezebel (1951)

Inevitably my list is turning out, because of its cinema bias, very US-heavy - here are a couple of rarities that buck that trend.

### Day 3 / Song #1 <br/> Carmen Miranda - South American Way (1939/40)
I've [written before about my love of South American Way](/swirling/2013/07/11/one-shot-south-american-way/)... tl;dr because of...
 - [Mildred Pierce (1945)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnCfyLq4SHQ) <-- youtube clip
 - [Radio Days (1987)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j-7FdyG_KE) <-- youtube clip
 - [Marlene Dietrich (in German)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgtAkHrMS6E)  <-- youtube clip
... but mostly, it's just because Carmen Miranda is wonderful:

### Day 4 / Song #2 <br/> Edith Piaf - Jezebel (1951)
... in the same "One shot" series I also sang the praises of [Jezebel](/swirling/2011/09/30/one-shot-jezebel/) - mostly I think because it practically became a rock 'n' roll standard, covered by the likes of Gene Vincent and Marty Wilde - but... Edith Piaf singing it in French is a lovely treat!
