 1. Deanna Durbin - It's Raining Sunbeams (from the 1937 film [One Hundred Men and a Girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Hundred_Men_and_a_Girl))
 2. Allan Jones - The Donkey Serenade (from the 1937 film [The Firefly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Firefly_(1937_film)))

Over the next 25 days I'll be picking my 50 favourite songs from before 1954 which inevitably for me will be quite US cinema heavy! This is all for "a music challenge in which players select their Top 25 to 50 singles/songs/recordings from the ‘Birth of Pop’ in the late 19th century to 31 December 1953" that's being [run online](https://bsky.app/profile/letsdoit25.bsky.social).

### Day 1 / Song #1 <br/>  Deanna Durbin - It's Raining Sunbeams (1937)

Deanna has such a lovely voice, and face, and a charm in those early films that no one ever came close to. _It's Raining Sunbeams_ was from the best of her films _One Hundred Men and a Girl_ which has Patsy (Deanna) getting (the actual) Leopold Stokowski to conduct an orchestra of unemployed musicians.

Here's my Deanna Durbin autograph... I like to pretend that my friends call me 'Archie'.

### Day 1 / Song #2 <br/> Allan Jones - Donkey Serenade (1937)

Allan was on my radar because of his appearances with The Marx Brothers, but _The Donkey Serenade_ was from _The Firefly_ where he starred opposite Jeanette MacDonald (who is in my #LetsDoIt25 long list but might not make the cut). This song became Allan Jones's signature song.
