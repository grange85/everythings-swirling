_Johnny Remember Me - John Leyton (1961)_  
The last of my _teenage tragedy songs_ but not my last Meek production.

The Wikipedia page for [Teenage tragedy songs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_tragedy_song) has little song plot summaries for each of the songs in their list. The one for Johnny Remember Me rather kills the brilliant spookiness of it!

<blockquote>
Protagonist's girlfriend died a year ago, cause unspecified, he still misses her.

Here are a couple that make them sound brilliant (and sadly better than the songs).

<blockquote>
Reckless boyfriend crashes car leaving girlfriend paraplegic; he robs a store to fund her surgery, gets shot by cops and lies dying at her feet as he realises she can walk after all.

<blockquote>
Narrator meets girl on the beach, then she dies in a shark attack. Devastated, the narrator picks up a knife and sets off to kill the shark in retribution.
