I knew very little about British jazz musician Barbara Thompson, and literally nothing about her _Paraphernalia_ project. I bought this LP for £4 from Discogs for the following reasons...

 - I could add it to my basket for no additional postage
 - The sleeve caught my eye
 - I needed something that wasn't _rock_ or _folk_ in the series

Weirdly, given [Barbara Thompson's reputation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Thompson_(musician)), the Internet offered very little in background to this release. I couldn't find any analysis, or reviews, or history of it... a Google search just revealed a few shops selling it and very little more. I'm not used to the Internet not coming good for me but this time it seemed to fail quite miserably. This, I felt, didn't bode well, although at least nobody was hating it... just nobody seemed to care about it. I even headed off to the British Newspaper Archive and found nothing.

Side one of the album is a 20 minute suite in five movements based on the Oscar Wilde short story for children "The Selfish Giant" and is, while clearly a _jazz_ suite, quite a bit rockier than I was expecting, and an enjoyable listen. The album had an insert with some extracts from Wilde's story to help put the music into context, although I opeted to listen to [Basil Rathbone's reading of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvdytaklTpQ) for my personal context. I rather liked this, although... stories without words is just music to my ears... sorry, but music I rather liked.

The suite was played live, at least once, for the BBC in August 1979 and was released on a 14(!) CD box set of Barbara Thompson recorded at the BBC, but even that, just four years old has disappeared into the ether (not that I was quite ready to pay £75 for a box set yet, I was hoping it would have made it onto a streaming service somewhere).

Side two of the album is filled out with some unrelated pieces. Despite having taken a _jazz appreciation_ course way back I do still rather struggle to _appreciate jazz_ - some I like and some I don't... I do quite like this, although sometimes it gets a little bit too... intricate for my tastes.

Barbara died a few years back after a long fight with Parkinsons disease, here's her [obit in the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/28/barbara-thompson-obituary).
