I have a problem with Vertigo and it mosty revolves around me not thinking it's quite as good as everyone else thinks it is! That's not to say that it isn't a great film. well acted, well paced, and well told. It's just that it's not Hitch's finest!

I suspect my issues with it are unique to me. Nobody's really likeable except the adorable Midge who is shockingly being overlooked by Scottie; I like a happy ending, and this was never going to give me one of them; some of the technical choices didn't work for me; Kim Novak's fringe when she's Judy!

But yes, it is still a great film and I rated it higher this time than I had in the two previous viewings I have ratings for from 2002 and 2012.
