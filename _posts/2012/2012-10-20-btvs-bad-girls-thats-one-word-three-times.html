<p>SO in Bad Girls...</p>
<p>...Wesley arrives, Faith and Buffy do the silly hands in the air dancing, a blobby villain gets fritzed and Faith kills a human... and goes bad. Despite all that, it was a bit forgettable... not much great dialog, not a great deal to laugh at, and it's hard to care.<br />
<img alt="" src="https://cdn.grange85.co.uk/swirling/btvs/grange85_dancing_badgirls.jpg" title="Faith and Buffy dance" /><br />
I thought I remembered Faith vigorously washing her hands and was going to link it in with <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/18/dirty-truth-toilet-taboos-handwashing">this piece by Rose George on how we could do with being a little more diligent on that front</a> - but when I went to grab a screencap it showed Faith vigorously washing her top.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Wesley</strong>: Remember the three key words for any Slayer: Preparation... preparation... preparation.<br />
<strong>Buffy</strong>: That's one word three times.</blockquote></p>
<p><strong>One word three times:</strong><br />

<p><strong>Rules of Buffy:</strong><br />
I pondered making the deputy mayor's demise an example of <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2011/01/15/btvs-the-pack-rip-principal-flutie/">Rule of Buffy #1</a> - but he wasn't really nice.</p>
<p>Maybe too early to say but could be a new Rule of Buffy - "If you dance with your hands above your head you're probably bad"</p>
