<p>OK - four months since we last watched an episode! </p>
<p>I actually like the idea of The Zeppo, it has some funny lines and funny scenes... but as <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2007/02/08/ive-never-been-up-with-people-before/">Hazel points out</a> (and will I'm sure point out again) the lack of consistency of characters is just annoying. To change a character just to fit him into a good idea is wrong and that's what happens here... shame.</p>
<p>And there's Buffy's hair<br />
</p>

<p>Some quotes</p>
<blockquote><p>Buffy: Maybe I'll check out Willy's <em>(it doesn't work written down which is why I cheated up there)</em><br />
</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>Giles: There's something... different about this... menace, something in the air... The stench of death.<br />
Xander:  Yeah, I think it's Bob.</blockquote></p>
<p>and... (obviously)</p>
<blockquote><p>Xander:  I'm suddenly very up. It's just, um... I've never been up with people before.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm not sure there's a great song about Zeppo... but there is one about another Marx Brother...</p>
