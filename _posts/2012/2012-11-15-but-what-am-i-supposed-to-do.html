<p>Damon Krukowski (of Galaxie 500<sup><a href="#justincase">*</a></sup>) wrote a <a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8993-the-cloud/">very interesting and quite depressing article on Pitchfork</a>, about how sites like Pandora and Spotify remunerate artists. But what can I, as a fan, music lover, listener, do about it - here are some thoughts - they are mine and mine alone, they are off the top of my head and a little muddled.</p>
<ul>
<li>I hate CDs, I always hated them, they are ghastly little bits of landfill - environmental timebombs. I have vowed to never buy another CD. I still buy records occasionally, for bands I love or for exceptionally beautiful artifacts.<br />
</li></p>
<li>I adore a world where the MUSIC is more important than the ARTIFACT</li>
<li>I adore ARTIFACTS</li>
<li>I want to give money to artists I love</li>
<li>I want a "radio" where I control what I listen to - that is music that I want to listen to but have no desire to own. I want the makers of this music to get some benefit of my listening... but this isn't the same as the point above.<br />
</li></p>
<li>I love that Spotify allows me to shoot off in bizarre directions, try stuff out, find the obscure and odd.</li>
<li>I believe there is a difference between buying a track and listening to a track on Spotify</li>
<li>I like to buy things - even things that don't have a physical manifestation.</li>
<li>I love what Kristin Hersh has done using her "Strange Angels" - a bunch of fans who pay a regular amount to her purely to enable her to make music - any perks are a bonus - the main thing is to allow a great artist to make art.</li>
<li>I know that while I can afford to do that for SOME artists I love I couldn't afford to do it for ALL artists I love.</li>
<li>I don't want to be a leech.</li>
<li>I don't believe musicians have a right to fame and fortune and anyone who makes music with that as a goal is probably not someone I'd respect (although I suspect there are many who do).</li>
<li>Kristin Hersh released her last album as a book with a download - I loved that!</li>
<li>I love books.</li>
<li>Kristin Hersh is releasing her next album as a book with a CD - I love that much less.</li>
<li>I love that this new age is encouraging artists to get innovative with how they get music to us.</li>
<li>I love Bandcamp.</li>
<li>I love the idea of a world built on trust and honesty - even if there are people who are neither trustworthy or honest.</li>
<li>I know that people steal music, but I also know they always did.</li>
<li>I don't go to many gigs these days.</li>
<li>I still buy and wear band T-shirts.</li>
<li>I want to help.</li></ul>
