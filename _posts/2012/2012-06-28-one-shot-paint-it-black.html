excerpt: "Actually this might be a bit short... as I start I have four in mind (and
  one of them's obviously the Stones).\r\n\r\nI was listening to <a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/dunwichradio/out-of-this-world/\">this
  rather excellent mixcloud mix</a> and on came this rather fab and slightly sunny
  cover by a band I'd never heard of called The Deep Six - it made me smile... - just
  after the \"I see a line of cars\" line there's a hilarious muppet-like <em>'meep
  meep'</em> - AllMusic guide were not so impressed...\r\n<blockquote>...even
  worse, \"Paint It Black,\" which sounds as goofy as if the Serendipity Singers were
  performing it after taking a few tokes for the first time</blockquote>\r\n<iframe

Next up the ever fantastic The Feelies - the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MiTZoE59_g">cover turned up on their first album</a> - and they've been playing regularly during the epic sets during their recent reunion - which this weekend involves <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2012/05/feelies_playing.html">three nights at Maxwell's in Hoboken</a> sadly too far from London!<br />
