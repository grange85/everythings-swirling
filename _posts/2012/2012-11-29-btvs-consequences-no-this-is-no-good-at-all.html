<p>... well actually it's not too bad...</p>
<p>... we start with a dream which is <em><a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2011/05/25/btvs-dead-mans-party-ok-we-get-it-rules-of-buffy-3/">Rules of Buffy #3</a> - If something doesn&rsquo;t seem quite right… it&rsquo;s a dream </em></p>
<p>... we also have Wesley and the Watchers Council heavies not killing Angel when they had a chance which sort of obeys <em><a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2011/02/27/btvs-whats-my-line-note-to-self-religion-freaky/">Rules of Buffy #2</a> - If you get an opportunity to despatch a particularly nasty demon… don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;ll probably work out fine</em> </p>
<p>we then rattle through a half-decent episode where lots of story happens, which is a relief because the story has been in need of picking up.</p>
<p>Despite that... I can think of nothing to say, so here's Willow... in her dungarees...<br />
