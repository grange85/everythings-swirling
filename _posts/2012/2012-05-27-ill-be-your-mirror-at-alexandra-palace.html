<p>Here are a few thoughts on my day spent at the lovely Alexandra Palace in north London where All Tomorrows Parties were hosting a three day festival:</p>
<p>Somehow ATP have managed to put on a festival that involves no women artists - certainly on the whole of Saturday I saw most performances and never saw a single woman on a stage (and I'm aware that at least three of the acts I never saw were all male) - this is a very poor show and made the whole event seem so... laddish.</p>
<p>The whole event was also relentlessly loud - I'd have loved to have had a day of variation, but it seems that no care had been taken in constructing the bill and instead they just grabbed a bunch of loud blokes with loud guitars (or a loud violin). I actually love many of the artists I saw yesterday but by the end I was yearning for something sweet and gentle.</p>
<p>We arrived, grabbed some (obviously nsanely overpriced) food and checked the main stage, the running order told us this was Floor - we lasted a song and then headed to the Panorama Room to watch the "metal bingo". We also checked out Chavez, also unimpressed.<br />

<p>Irmin Schmidt of Can then played us a few tracks from the forthcoming "Lost Tapes" collection - which was good - but the room was getting too hot so we headed out to try and find ice-cream.</p>
<p>We returned for the excellent Codeine, a band I've long loved but had never managed to see before... they were as good as expected but would have benefited from a smaller stage in a more appropriate environment.</p>
<p>Mudhoney were pretty much exactly what I'd expected... which is not a bad thing... well, exactly what I'd expected until the drum solo - last drum solo I saw I walked out of - leave solo-ing to the metal and jazz lot... it's OK-ish then. Also, nice to know there's an Iggy ready to step into Iggy's shoes when (if) he decides to retire!<br />

<p></p>
<p>Dirty Three were probably great -but they were also loud and by now I was desperate for some respite, so we retired to the Panorama Room to hear Balam Acab make some enjoyable and interesting electronic noodles.</p>
<p>Finally Mogwai, another band I've followed for years but I'd never got around to seeing. They made a lot of noise and it was great, but I was done. The end came just about when it needed to, and thankfully we were spared an encore.<br />
