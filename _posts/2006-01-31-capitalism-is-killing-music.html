<p>I have the audio cassettes, vinyl, I upgraded to CDs, I bough the "Essential" compilation and now Billy Bragg is releasing a great big fat <a href="http://www.billybragg.co.uk/news/news_story.php?id=309">box set</a> of his early releases - packed with extras and a couple of DVDs. How many times do I have to own "Talking With The Taxman..."?</p></p>
<p>And this is only volume one...It will of course be worth every penny</p>
<p><b>UPDATE:</b> You can now pre-order a signed copy of the box set from <a href="http://www.billybragg.co.uk/shop/index.html">billybragg.co.uk</a></p></p>
