<p>I just noticed that <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Seefeel" class="bbcode_artist">Seefeel</a>'s very excellent <a title="Seefeel - Quique" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Seefeel/Quique" class="bbcode_album">Quique</a> is getting a luxury release with an extra disc of rarities which inspired me to dig out my Seefeel discs which I haven't listened to for far too long...<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I'll probably download the bonus disc (if it gets a digital release) because I've decided that buying music I already own is a silly thing to do and I won't do it any more!</p>
