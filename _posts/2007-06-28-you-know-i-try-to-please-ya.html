<p>I love hearing (and seeing!) folk covering Luna or Galaxie 500 and while this might not be as weird as <a href="http://blog.fullofwishes.co.uk/swirling/2006/11/24/why-i-adore-the-internet/">Tugboat on a steel drum</a> it's a very nice cover of Luna's Anesthesia. The <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=sFPUBfhyTB0">YouTube page</a> has guitar tab and lyrics and <a href="http://youtube.com/user/mendi244">mendi244</a> has done stacks of other cool covers for your enjoyment (although as yet no more Luna)...<br />

<p>I hated having to put "ya" in the title but "you" was wrong because no matter how hard I tried it just wouldn't rhyme with anesthesia...</p>
