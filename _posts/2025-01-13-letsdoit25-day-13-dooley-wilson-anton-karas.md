### Day 13 / Song #1<br/>Dooley Wilson - As Time Goes By (from [Casablanca (1942)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film))
My sister and I used to hang a cassette mic in front of the telly speaker and record songs from films - so the version of As Time Goes By has all the dialog as well as the song, so maybe could be credited to _Dooley Wilson / Ingrid Bergman / Humphrey Boagrt_ and is in two parts:

First when Ilsa asks Sam to play it "for old times sake"...

... and then when drunken Rick insists "you played it for her, you can play it for me. If she can stand it I can! Play it!"...

### Day 9 / Song #2<br/>Anton Karas - "[The Third Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Man)" Theme (1949)
This is another one that I find difficult to separate from it's visuals - it seems I _need_ to see the zither strings when I listen to this, and also Carol Reed's introduction "I never knew the old Vienna before the war, with it's Strauss music, it's glamour and easy charm. Constantinople suited me better."
