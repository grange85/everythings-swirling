I saw A Private Function when it was released in 1984 - I wasn't a vegetarian then, that happened five or six years later. I haven't seen it since, it seems odd that a film I'm sure I enjoyed didn't ever inspire me to re-watch. We watched it on Wednesday night and I thoroughly enjoyed it - it was sweet, and subtly funny, and wonderfully acted by a fine cast of heavyweights. It was, however a film about butchering a pig, and (spoiler after the clip)...</p>

<p>... it doesn't have a happy ending for Betty, the pig.</p>
