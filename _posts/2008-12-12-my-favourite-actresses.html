<p>Hazel just <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2008/12/11/favourite-actresses/">posted her favourite actresses</a> and "tagged" me to do the same...so here goes...</p></p>
<p>This was too hard for me, I found it very difficult to think of actresses separately from films. I suspect that most of these are here because they've been in films I love rather than because they are necessarily actresses that I would watch unconditionally. I wonder if I would find it easier with actors.</p></p>
<p>When I was younger Marilyn Monroe would have been on this list but really, I can probably only watch one film of hers now and she's not the reason it's great, I suspect my "thing" for Monroe was all about being a boy reaching a certain age and discovering certain feelings. The only actresses on this list that fit Hazel's "any old nonsense" criteria are Jodie Foster and Julia Roberts.</p></p>
<p>I'm surprised at how my list is dominated by more recent actresses when the films I love tend to be older.</p></p>
<p>I couldn't get to twenty so here's ten...</p>
<ul>
<li>Jodie Foster</li>
<li>Winona Ryder</li>
<li>Priscilla Lane - OK I probably need to explain this one becuase it sort of surprised me. She has been in three films that I can happily watch over and over again and she is so good in all three of them, so natural and comfortable.</li>
<li>Ginger Rogers</li>
<li>Kate Winslet</li>
<li>Reese Witherspoon</li>
<li>Margaret Dumont</li>
<li>Joan Cusack</li>
<li>Katherine Hepburn</li>
<li>Julia Roberts</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Technically I guess I should be "tagging" people to carry this on, but I'm not sure I have the confidence or coverage so if you read this and fancy having a go...consider yourself tagged.</p></p>
