<p>Harpo was the Marx Brother I loves as a kid, he was the clown and you didn't need to worry about listening to the words to find his humour... but I have to say that when he played his harp... I'd sort of lose interest - Chico's piano playing never did that.</p>

<p>Now I'm more grown up and I get Jojo's appreciation!</p>
