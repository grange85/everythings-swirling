<p>I've spent far too much of today worrying about whether the song that Britta's singing in this very cool video is called "You Turn My Head Around" which is what it says in the video, on their website and all over the web or "You Turned My Head Around" which is what it says on the album sleeve, on <a href="http://www.somevelvetmorning.net/Lh11.html">a Lee Hazlewood website</a> and what Britta appears to be singing (mostly).</p>

<p>How sad am I? The answer is "very".</p>
