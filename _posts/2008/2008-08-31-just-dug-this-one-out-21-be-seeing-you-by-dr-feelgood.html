<p>My dad used to volunteer at the local <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._John_Ambulance">St John's Ambulance</a> book sales and for a while in the late 70s and early 80s you'd always find a pile of records at these sales that had clearly been donated by some local, music industry insider. Stacks of unplayed promos and, being a St John's Ambulance sale, I was probably the only person under 50 and therefore got the opportunity to plough through and fill my boots without any competition. A flick through my record collection even now would reveal a fair few with "Promo only - not for resale" stickers.</p>
<p>One such record was a 7" single of She's A Windup/Baby Jane by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Feelgood_(band)">Dr Feelgood</a> and, like a fair few of the records I got from the sales, it went a good many weeks unplayed. A school friend was a huge Feelgood fan and so I offered it to him because he would obviously appreciate it more. He said he would gladly take it off my hands but insisted that before I even thought about giving it away that I really ought to listen to it so I went home that afternoon and had another one of those life-changing moments - the awesome opening guitar riff just blew me away...I still have the single and treasure it.</p>
<p>Suddenly I was a Feelgood fan and ploughed backwards through their catalogue, went to gigs (well into the 80s) and discovered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilko_Johnson">Wilko Johnson</a> (who had left the band before I discovered them) and saw him even more and even longer. Even now I occasionally dip my feet into that river and get a buzz that is more than just nostalgia.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicbrainz.org/release/67f758fd-5c09-456b-aeb7-e8f539280ccc.html">Be Seeing You</a> probably isn't my favourite Feelgood album, the lyrical obsession with sex gets tiresome and borderline misogynistic (moreso than on any of the other albums) most notably I guess in the song that got me into them. Some of the songs are pedestrian or formulaic ("That's It, I Quit", "Sixty Minutes of Your Love", "As Long as the Price is Right") but in Windup, "Looking Back" and "Baby Jane" there is so much energy and thrill that I understand what happened to me when I put on that single all those years ago.</p><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/e6oSM8lhc84&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/e6oSM8lhc84&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></p>
<p>A few years later my life was changed again by a record I found at the St John's Ambulance sales...REM's Reckoning.</p>
