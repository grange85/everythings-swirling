<p>BUT there's a mistake - and it may be a mistake inconsequential to most readers but it <em>really</em> bothers me. In describing Luna's last show Dean suggests that Indian Summer was the closing song of the closing show - he describes his emotions and the way he steps back to listen to Sean - it's sweet and emotional...<strong>BUT WRONG</strong>. The last song Luna played was 23 Minutes in Brussels - the written set list had Indian Summer as the last song but apparently the band made a last minute decision to swap it with 23 Minutes which was due to be the penultimate track.</p>
<p>You can go <a href="http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2008/02/28/three-years-ago-today/">here and listen to the last two tracks in the correct order</a>, <a href="http://lunaslastwaltz.blogspot.com/2005/03/lunas-last-waltz.html">here to view the post I made the morning after</a> or <a href="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/gigography/show/684/">here to see a load of pictures of Luna at the last show</a>...where they finished with 23 Minutes in Brussels.</p>
<p>OK...glad to have got that off my chest.</p><br />
