<p>I loved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Our_Living_Room_to_Yours">From Our Living Room to Yours</a> when I first got hold of it...so much so that <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011207201354/www.grange85.co.uk/amanset/index.php">I made a web page</a> dedicated to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Analog_Set">The American Analog Set</a>. In those early days of the Web that was a legitimate way of declaring love...well it <a href="http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk">was for me anyway</a></p>
<p>I remember listening on headphones to the adorable opening of Magnificent Seventies and being totally sucked in. But I stopped listening to Amanset - I kept buying the albums but stopped listening to them, I stopped updating the website and when Amanset finally called it a day it was frankly a bit of a relief. It turns out that I probably never really loved them at all - and maybe all I really, truly loved was the first 9 minutes of this album...and even that at a push...lets say the first 4 minutes...</p>
<p>And listening now I'm beginning to see why, I'm fond of drone and (clearly) not averse to gentle pace but something is missing, something that could pull this out of "nice" and into "gripping" something that could prevent the word B-O-R-I-N-G from popping into my head...but it keeps popping in. Maybe sometimes it almost pulls me back in but then it lets me go again and I drift away thinking of other things and not really hearing the music anymore.</p>
<p>Maybe it's me, maybe I don't have the patience and skill required to enjoy this music anymore.</p></p>
