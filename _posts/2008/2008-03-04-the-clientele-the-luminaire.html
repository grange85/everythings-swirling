<p>Another visit to the Luminaire to see <a href="http://www.theclientele.co.uk/">The Clientele</a>...and another excellent Clientele show, despite Alasdair's quips about being strangely nervous they seemed very relaxed. Nice set - some old, some less old, nothing new ("we'll play some new songs next time because we have some rehearsed...but they<del datetime="2008-03-04T09:56:58+00:00">'re</del><ins datetime="2008-03-04T09:56:58+00:00"> sound</ins> shit") the wig out during Lamplight is getting to be a set highlight.</p>
<p>Support from <a href="http://www.theleftoutsides.com">The Left Outsides</a> (again) - I enjoyed them more than last time - and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/theseeseeband">The See See</a> who were also very good.</p><br />
