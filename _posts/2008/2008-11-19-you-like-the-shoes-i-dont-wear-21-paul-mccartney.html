<p>After <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2008/11/18/just-dug-this-one-out-24-sgt-peppers-lonely-hearts-club-band-by-the-beatles/">railing at Sgt. Pepper</a>, and inspired to listen to McCartney's solo and Wings work it seemed that it was also time to sing the praises of Paul's footwear of choice.</p>
<p>I could rant as much about how I don't like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_Road_(album)">Abbey Road</a>, we listened to it last night and if anything it reaffirmed my dislike of it...but there's not much point - I think I could count the post-Pepper Beatles songs I like on one hand.</p><br /></p>
