<p>Tagged a while back by <a href="http://laughingwild.blogspot.com/2008/11/7-best-albums-meme.html">maurinsky</a> (via <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2008/12/15/no-insights-here/">Hazel</a>)</p>
<p>This is tricky, mostly tricky because of all I've had to leave out (two Galaxie 500 albums for starters).</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Fire_(Galaxie_500_album)">On Fire</a> - Galaxie 500 (1989)</strong><br/>Best album ever. Nothing more to say (except that its appearance in this list also represents the band's entire output and that of Luna, Damon & Naomi and Dean & Britta</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ys_(Joanna_Newsom_album)">Ys</a> - Joanna Newsom (2006)</strong><br/>Stunningly ambitious and beautifully realised and one day <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2006/12/31/peonies-nod-in-the-breeze-and-while-they-wetly-bow-with-hydrocephalitic-listlessness-ants-mop-up-a-their-brow/">you all</a> will realise just how perfect a piece of art this is.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Name">Secret Name</a> - Low (1999)</strong><br/>I normally pick "I Could Live in Hope" as my fave Low album, but Secret Name is beautiful and is (according to last.fm) the Low album I listen to more than any other.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Velvet_Underground_(album)">The Velvet Underground</a> - The Velvet Underground (1969)</strong><br/>The third VU album is awesome and the contrast between this and White Light/White Heat just makes it better (that doesn't mean that I don't love White Light/White Heat).</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hounds_of_love">Hounds of Love</a> - Kate Bush (1985)</strong><br/>Hounds of Love was my by-myself album of choice for a long time. Listening now it's remarkable as well in that it manages to not suffer from the time it was made. <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2008/05/16/just-dug-this-one-out-16-the-hounds-of-love-by-kate-bush/">Previously on Everything's Swirling</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_You%27re_Feeling_Sinister">If You're Feeling Sinister</a> - Belle & Sebastian (1996)</strong><br/>Just really sweet pop. <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2008/02/07/just-dug-this-one-out-13-if-youre-feeling-sinister-by-belle-sebastian/">Previously on Everything's Swirling</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horses_patti_smith">Horses</a> - Patti Smith (1975)</strong><br/>Whenever I listen to this album I'm stunned I don't listen to it more.</p>
<p>All the places on this list with the exception of the first two are vulnerable from attack from <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2008/07/07/just-dug-this-one-out-18-overkill-by-motorhead/">Motorhead</a>, Brian, Nina Nastasia, Throwing Muses, Stereolab, Yo La Tengo or any one of hundreds of others.</p><br />
