<p>Today we finally finished getting Adam prepped for high school (or secondary school as it used to be called) so today's almost random picture is of me 33 years ago ready for my first day at secondary school (or high school as they call it these days). As a bonus you also get to see Helen posing in her uniform too!</p></p>
