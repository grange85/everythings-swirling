<p>I've resisted <a href="http://twitter.com/grange85">Twitter</a> for so long...I joined up a few months ago after succumbing to the barrage of online pressure but never got beyond the registration phase. There are so many problems I have with it...the prime one being "who really gives a chuff what I'm up to?" - maybe Hazel (but I see her every day) but that really is probably about it. That does throw into doubt why I should have this blog but there is a whole difference between <em>speaking your mind (and no one caring)</em> and making 140 character posts about being on the bus or listening to the radio...my life is just not interesting enough.</p>
<p>But anyway - <a href="http://twitter.com/grange85">here I am</a> - making those 140 character yawns that no one will care about and wondering if I'll have a Damascus moment...and it'll all make sense...</p>
<p>(It aditionally doesn't help that I almost always forget to have my phone with me)</p>
