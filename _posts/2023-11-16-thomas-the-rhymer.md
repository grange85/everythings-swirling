Two facts:

 - Hazel has family who live in Melrose, so we have visited and stayed in the town many times over the years.
 - Steeleye Span's _Now We Are Six_ has been a favourite Span album of mine for many years (pre-dating my metal and indie phases), and Thomas the Rhymer is the best track on it.

<div class="aligncenter"><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/53336151676/in/dateposted/" title="The Rhymer&#x27;s Stone"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53336151676_0ff526373e_c.jpg" width="800" height="800" alt="The Rhymer&#x27;s Stone"/></a></div>

 Until earlier this year those facts were, in my mind, completely unrelated. Then I learned that the _Huntley Bank_ on which _True_ Thomas encountered _a lady gay_ was in Melrose. And the tree under which he sat that fateful day when he met the Queen of the Fairies has been commemorated by a stone erected by the _Melrose Literary Society_ in 1929.

 So today, since we were visiting Hazel's family we also visited the site of Thomas the Rhymer's encounter.
