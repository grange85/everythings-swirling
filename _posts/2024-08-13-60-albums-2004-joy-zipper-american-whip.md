I might have heard Joy Zipper before Jen got me to see them at ULU, but I'm not entirely sure I'd really _listened_ to them. But... in May 2004 Jen was in town, and so were Joy Zipper promoting "American Whip" so, I let Jen talk me into that one. Oddly, I didn't seem to take my camera along... so, no pics.

It was a good show, although, it was 20 years ago now so I can't really remember _how good_ - but definitely good enough to have me go out and buy the album, and buy their previous and subsequent releases all of which are good, but I think American Whip is their best. There is surprisingly little live footage of them - although there is this clip of them playing _1_ from their last album at The Water Rats in London, sort of sad I managed to miss this.

They seemed to come to an end around then, although I just noticed that they did some _lockdown stuff_ in 2020 - here they are doing Out of The Sun from American Whip.

I'm guessing the idyllic surroundings, the dog, and the small child contributed to their hiatus?

_Finally trying to get this series to an end, it fell by the wayside during [#LET5D0IT](/swirling/category/let5d0it/) and never recovered... until now_
