I took Adam to see Gordon from <a href="http://www.ballboy.org">Ballboy</a> on Friday night - unfortunately the two support acts went on a bit too long and by the time Gordon hit the stage (well the floor at the front of the room) Adam was barely awake and looking<br /><br />
forward to going home...</p></p>
<p>It was a good show for all that. Started with "A Day in Space" which was not only great - but a song that Adam could relate to (he's going through a bit of a space phase at the moment). And a song about cannibals falling in love and having to deal with the  double-edged sword of desire/delectation was also amusing.</p></p>
<p>I think I enjoyed it more than Adam but he did recognise songs when I played them to him ("he did this one didn't he?"). </p></p>
