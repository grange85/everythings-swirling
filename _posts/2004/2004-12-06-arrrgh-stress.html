<p>I had Grade 3 my piano exam on Saturday afternoon. On Sat morning all alone in the house I sounded like <a href="http://www.deccaclassics.com/artists/ashkenazy/">Ashkenazy</a> or <a href="http://home.achilles.net/~howardm/tsmonk/tsmonk.php">Monk </a> - by Sat afternoon in front of two strangers I sounded like <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/l/lesdawsonshowthe_7772125.shtml">Les Dawson</a>.</p>
<p>I have my fingers crossed that I've scraped through but I'm not convinced. Onto Grade 4 and time to start addressing my performance anxiety</p></p><br /></p>
