<p>I'm still such a rubbish blogger. I signed up for a <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> account because I'm not only rubbish at blogging but I'm also rubbish at sharing the thousands of photos we take with our friends and family and flickr seemed a good way of fixing that.</p>
<p>Still playing around with it at the moment but the fact that I can blog from it might inspire me to keep this a little more up-to-date.</p>
<p>This pic was taken on a walk the three of us did along the river near Teddington Locks.</p>
