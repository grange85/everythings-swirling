_Puff the Magic Dragon - Peter, Paul and Mary (1963)_  
Oh god, there can't be a song sadder than this! I mean dying is all very well (and there are a fair few dying songs in my list), but living forever with a broken heart - that is unbearably sad! In fact it's so unbearably sad that I'm actually not sure it should be in my list at all!
