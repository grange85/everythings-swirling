<p>I've loved Kate Bush pretty much since day one, and despite all the other music I've gone in and out of since, there's always been Kate. The first time Hazel and I went out for lunch (rather than being drunk somewhere) we talked about Kate Bush... we may have talked about other things (probably films... the things we still talk about) but I don't remember, but I know for certain we talked about Kate.</p>
<p>In 1979 Kate Bush played her last tour, she played The Hammersmith Odeon. In 1979 I saw my first gig, it was at The Hammersmith Odeon. It was Mot&ouml;rhead and Saxon.</p>
<p>This is how this morning went...</p>
<p>09:00 Breakfasted, dressed and ready for work but not going anywhere until I have got (or failed to get) Kate Bush tickets<br />
09:25 Sitting at my computer... waiting... stressed<br />
09:29 Refreshed the three browser tabs each with a different ticket agent. Two of them died. Ticketmaster told me that tickets where unavailable.<br />
09:30 Refreshed Ticketmaster. Picked a date, chose "best available" in the seat options, picked two in the number of seats.<br />
09:34 Got an email confirmation for two tickets.<br />
09:35 Sunk in just how much I'd paid for those two tickets.<br />
09:40 Phone call from Hazel saying that she too had been successful (for a different night).<br />
09:41 Sunk in just how much we'd paid for those four tickets.</p>

<p>In 2014 I'll get to see Kate Bush at The Hammersmith Odeon. I've no idea what to expect from Kate's gig, she is after all in her 50s... but I think I'd quite like it to be as mental as this...</p>
