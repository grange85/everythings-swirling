<p>...in a house that, more often than not, had country music playing, his was the country music I could like. It was rougher and rawer than Dolly or Jim Reeves. More importantly though, as I grew up, I was aware of his impact beyond music. His awareness of social and political issues meant that he was someone I could respect beyond his music, rather than be ashamed of. While I'll admit that I don't often listen to his records these days I'll still miss him - the world was a much better place yesterday.</p></p>
