1. Gene Krupa and his Orchestra (vocal chorus by Anita O'Day) - Watch The Birdie (1941)
2. Tommy Dorsey and his Clambake Seven (vocal refrain by Edythe Wright) - The Music Goes 'Round and Around (1936) (BONUS 11pt)

Two that aren't really _from_ films, but both are here _because of films_!

### Day 2 / Song #3 - Gene Krupa and his Orchestra (vocal chorus by Anita O'Day) - Watch The Birdie (1941)
I love this song initially because of it's appearance in the fab, and completely bonkers 1941 film [Hellzapoppin'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellzapoppin%27_(film)) where it's sung by Martha Raye (and is wonderful and could very easily have been my pick), but this version by Gene Krupa and his Orchestra with Anita O'Day singing is just a little bit... richer!

Here's Martha performing it in Hellzapoppin, it might be better, but it might be better just because of the film so I've gone with the other!

### Day 2 / Song #4 - Tommy Dorsey and his Clambake Seven (vocal refrain by Edythe Wright) - The Music Goes 'Round and Around (1936)
I'm not sure if I'd heard this before it played over the end credits of the 2009 film [Me and Orson Welles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_and_Orson_Welles) but that is definitely where I fell in love with it (more than the film) - this has the most charming delivery of any song in my list - and I do love charm! That's why it's getting a bonus point.
