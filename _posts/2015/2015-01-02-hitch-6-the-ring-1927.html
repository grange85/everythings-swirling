But for the story The Ring is a splendid film. It looks great (and the print on our DVD was a gem), it has plenty of Hitch pushing the edges of film-making. It has some fine acting from the three leads and lots of lovely character work from the support. It has a terrific party scene with dancing and ukuleles. Even the boxing scenes are brilliantly energetic and pretty convincing.<br />

<p>But unfortunately it has a rather dull, and frightfully predictable, love-triangle story wrapped around all of this greatness.</p>
