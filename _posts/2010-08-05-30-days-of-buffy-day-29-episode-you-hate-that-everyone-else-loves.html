<div>As <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2010/07/24/30-days-of-buffy-day-19-character-you-like-that-everyone-else-hates/">previously mentioned</a> I don&#39;t really have any insight into what "everyone" likes or dislikes in Buffy so this is another one I&#39;ll clearly struggle with. <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2010/08/04/30-days-of-buffy-day-29/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+LetsFoldScarves+%28Let%27s+Fold+Scarves%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">Luckily Hazel</a> has again pointed me at this <a href="http://www.phi-phenomenon.org/buffy/byrank">ordered list of Buffy episodes</a> for my perusal so I&#39;ll start reading and stop as soon as I hit one I was less than enamoured with. Sit tight...
<p /> Oh... and there it is at #25 - The Prom - creepy and dull and a little bit of an illusion-buster of an episode. Mostly ebcause of the umbrella thing. The umbrella thing was sad and ridiculous and bothered me when I frist saw it and bothers me still. I can&#39;t imagine that it ranks as high as 25 but maybe that&#39;s all the romantics marking up for the dance...
<p />
<div style="text-align: center;"> <br /> </div><br />That was easier than expected.
