<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/uthansasia/4971313307/" title=""I Am" by ▓UTH▲N▓, on Flickr"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4143/4971313307_3e53063909_z.jpg" width="640" height="424" alt=""I Am""></a>I've never really got Oasis, so this was the first time I'd ever sat down and listened to an album of theirs... I was fully prepared to hate it and was ready to vent my spleen (whatever the hell that means).</p>
<p>Two observsations:<br />
So many singles! Considering I'd never heard this album before I was surprisingly familiar with at least half the songs on it. One of these, Don't Look Back in Anger, I was even slightly fond of as it had been used for the closing scene of Our Friends in the North.</p>
<p>I couldn't hate this album because it really had nothing to hate, given how offensive the Gallagher brothers are, they did manage to make a completely inoffensive album - you can't hate an album that manages to stir up no emotions. It's indie-music-wallpaper - it's just there. You can tap your foot, or nod your head, but not even Liam's whine, and hilarious pronunciayasheeyuhnsaah managed to engender any reaction from me. Nope, (What's The Story) Morning Glory? is just a pint of Young's Ordinary. It's a session beer you can drink all night and not get pissed.</p>
<p>Bonus observation:<br />
Rather sweet how a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=what%27s%20the%20story%20morning%20glory%20oasis%20cover">search on flickr</a> finds pictures of folk re-enacting the cover in Berwick Street.</p>
