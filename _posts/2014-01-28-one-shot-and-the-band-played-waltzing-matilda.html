<p>Dean Wareham has a <a href="http://deanwareham.tumblr.com">new Tumblr</a> where he's posting a "song of the week", this weeks song is Eric Bolgle's <a href="http://deanwareham.tumblr.com/post/74845014706/song-of-the-week-and-the-band-played-waltzing">And The Band Played Waltzing Matilda as performed by The Bushwackers</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>This song has been covered by Shane McGowan, Joan Baez, and many others but the Bushwackers do the definitive version.</blockquote><br />
It may be definitive, but I'd take The Pogues version over it. The Bushwacker's version is beautiful and sad but The Pogues version adds a healthy dose of anger and it certainly affects me more because of it - although maybe the familiarity affects me.</p>

<p>I saw The Pogues a stack of times in the mid/late 80s and live it was even more moving, and not in any way made less powerful by the drunken rowdiness of crowd and band</p>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Another great Eric Bogle track that can bring me to tears is The Green Fields of France as covered by The Men They Couldn't Hang</p>
