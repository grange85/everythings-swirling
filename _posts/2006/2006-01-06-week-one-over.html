<p>The first post in my pretty new <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> blog.</p></p>
<p>A week at work gazing vacantly at the PC monitor drowning in a wash of 80s indie (JaMC, Sonic Youth, Stone Roses) and 60s Jazz (Miles, Cannonball, Bill Evans, Monk) and wondering what my first new purchase of the year will be. My <a href="http://www.normanrecords.com/reviews.php">Norman records</a> email update came and went without any great inspiration. and a lazy trawl around my favourite blogs was equally unproductive. Maybe its too early in the year to be inspired.</p></p>
<p>Baffling is the only possible word to describe <a href="http://www.stylusmagazine.com/">Stylus's</a> description of Spiritualized's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=aheadfullofwi-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B000003RSB%2526tag=aheadfullofwi-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B000003RSB%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82" title="View product details at Amazon">Lazer Guided Melodies</a> as</p>
<blockquote><p>pallid and homogeneous</blockquote></p>
<p>and more baffled by the list of agreeing comments. It comes as part of <a href="http://www.stylusmagazine.com/feature.php?ID=2065">Stylus's reassesment</a> of the band's second album <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=aheadfullofwi-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B000002VUG%2526tag=aheadfullofwi-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B000002VUG%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82" title="View product details at Amazon">Pure Phase</a> which I've also recently rediscovered.</p></p>
