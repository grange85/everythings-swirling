<p>A Head Full of Wishes has been my (internet) pride and joy for eleven years now but the "original" and "exclusive" content has been pretty limited so I'm quite proud of having Q&A interviews with all the former members of Luna showing up over the next few weeks - <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/galaxie/index.php?article_id=133">first up is Britta</a> talking about the upcoming film and the farewell tour. Over the next few weeks there'll be posts from Lee, Sean, Dean and documentary film-maker Matthew Buzzell.</p>
<p>Now I know getting a Q&A from Luna was not a hard thing to do but I never did it before so I can still be proud...<a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/hazel/">Hazel</a> chose to mock me for doing a scarily anal annotation of the "interview" but I felt the need to milk it!</p>
