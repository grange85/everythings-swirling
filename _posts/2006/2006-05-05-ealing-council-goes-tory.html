<p>When you wake up to the fact that your council is Tory<br/><br />
Just remember, there are two sides to every story</br><br />
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/vote2006/locals/html/aj.stm">BBC NEWS | Election 2006 | Seat-by-seat | Ealing council</a></p>
<p>I want to blame the people of Ealing for putting these vermin back in charge but the blame really has to lay at the doorstep of the Labour party leadership for being out of touch. It was Blair who lost this election - not the council.</p>
