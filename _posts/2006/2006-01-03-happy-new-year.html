<p>Oh I meant to do so much here - with lists and links and music and books and stuff - but in the end a miserable cold just had me staring blankly and uninspired. We've all had a cold since christmas so our house has been a cacophony of coughs, sneezes and moans.</p>
<p><b>records</b> (in no particular order)
<ul>
<li>Espers - <a href="http://www.espers.org/">Espers</a><br />
<a href="http://moley75.blogspot.com/">Hazel</a> bought this for herself - I stole it and listened to it a lot</li>
<li>Strange Geometry - <a href="http://www.theclientele.co.uk/">The Clientele</a><br />
and still they can do no wrong</li>
<li>Picaresque - <a href="http://www.decemberists.com/">The Decemberists</a><br />
Fantastic more-of-the-same album - their indie label swansong</li>
<li>The Earth is Blue - <a href="http://www.damonandnaomi.com">Damon and Naomi</a><br />
The very best D&amp;N album got released in 2005</li>
<li>EP - <a href="http://heylisa.net/audrey/">Audrey</a><br />
Oh this was such a beautiful surprise possibly the best new thing to happen to me last year</li></ul></p>
<p><b>books</b>
<ul>
<li>Carter Beats The Devil - Glen David Gold</li>
<li>Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay - Michael Chabon</li></ul>I know they're both quite old but they were the best books I <i>read</i> last year</p>
<p>Ugh that'll do - I'm off to sneeze again - have a great 2006</p></p>
