<p>OK - so it requires me to be a little more careful about what I buy as I rarely research beforehand and have been surprised and disappointed by a few of my purchases but <a href="http://www.pledgebank.com/boycottdrm">I will pledge to never purchase a CD contaning any form of Digital Rights Management (DRM)</a> (via <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/08/pledge_to_boycott_dr.html">Boing Boing</a>).</p>
<p>I feel dirty when I do so it only makes sense. I think the last DRM CDs I'll buy are probably the Blue Note CDs I bought last week (they haven't arrived yet and I know that not all Blue Note discs use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_control">EMI's corruption</a> so I'm crossing my fingers).</p>
<p>I hate saying <b>never</b> but hopefully this one will be able to stick becasue if the record labels want to assume I'm a thief then I'd rather not give them any of my money.</p></p>
