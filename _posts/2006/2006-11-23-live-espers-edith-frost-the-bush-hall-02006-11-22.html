<p>I first heard of Espers when they played some dates with Damon & Naomi in 2004 but never followed up until Hazel suggested that I really should. I love how they sound so full, I love that they love (British) folk music, I love how Greg and Meg have such beautiful voices that work so well together...or apart, I love how they make their (and other peoples) songs into an experience. Last night I got the chance to love all of that live...and I did.</p>
<p>Edith Frost did a good but short support slot of her lovely country-folk songs.</p>
<p>Managed to miss most of Hush Arbors but saw enough to wish I hadn't.</p>
