<p>I love when things I love like comics and music overlap so seeing <a href="http://www.drawnandquarterly.com/blog/2006_11_01_archive.php#116316952852497688">this in Drawn and Quarterly</a> or a Galaxy [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic">sic</a>] 500 poster in Craig Thompson's "Blankets" will always give me a buzz (sad huh?).</p>
