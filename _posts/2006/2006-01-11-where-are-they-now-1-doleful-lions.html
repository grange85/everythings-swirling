<p>OK this is a bit lame because it's not like I've done any great research trying to track down what happened to <a href="http://www.parasol.com/artists/dolefullions.asp">Doleful Lions</a> - in fact I've just sat here listening to their fabulous 2002 album <a href="">Out Like A Lamb</a> and wondered when the follow up is going to arrive. It's probably even a little bit more pathetic becasue despite absolutely adoring this album I haven't actually got off my behind and bought any of their previous releases - should rectify that soon I guess</p>
<p>You can listen to a couple of mp3s on the <a href="http://website.lineone.net/~alun-jones/brokenhorsediscog.html">Broken Horse</a> website (Broken Horse released the album in Europe and were kind enough to send me a copy gratis - which makes me feel even worse now becasue not only do I love it I didn't even pay for it!!).<br />
mp3s from <a href="http://website.lineone.net/~alun-jones/brokenhorsediscog.html">Broken Horse Records</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://website.lineone.net/~alun-jones/tanahlot.mp3">Tanah Lot (mp3)</p>
<li><a href="http://website.lineone.net/~alun-jones/standinthecolosseum.mp3">Stand in the Colosseum (mp3)</a></li></ul></p>
