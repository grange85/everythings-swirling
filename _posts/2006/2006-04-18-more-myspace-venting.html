<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/17/technology/17link.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">This article from the New York Times</a> seems to suggest that MySpace is acceptable because of it's democratic nature - it's because anyone is allowed to create ugly, hateful pages that the site is so popular. That would be so sad if it were true. I'm not convinced - I think its popular despite that. I think its popular because of some strange freak of nature/timing/luck and that its popularity is the ONLY thing that keeps it going - there's almost an obligation to embrace MySpace merely because everyone else is - it makes me want to cry.</p>
