<p>Way back in the last century, when the Internet was young and fresh and exciting one of my first Inernet "friends" was a chap called Michael Kentoff who was in a rather excellent band from Washington DC called <a href="http://www.littlevoice.com/townies/">Townies</a>. The band released a couple of cracking little albums and then some time in the late 90s they became <a href="http://www.thecaribbeanisaband.com/">The Caribbean</a>. Michael sent me their first EP and then we sort of fell out of touch - and I assumed that The Caribbean was no more.</p>
<p>Yesterday while doing my daily trawl for Galaxie 500 related blogs and articles I came across an interview that Damon had done for webzine <a href="http://www.erasingclouds.com/">Erasing Clouds</a> as part of an ongoing project called <a href="http://www.erasingclouds.com/hundredQA.html">100 Musicians Answer the Same 10 Questions</a>. Damon was <a href="http://www.erasingclouds.com/wk1906damon.html">number 22</a> and much to my surprise <a href="http://www.erasingclouds.com/wk1706carib.html">number 6</a> featured Michael Kentoff of The Caribbean.</p>
<p>It seems that in the years I'd assumed the band had faded away they had in fact been going from strength to strength - they have released a couple of well received albums and were still very much a going concern. The <a href="http://www.thecaribbeanisaband.com/">official website</a> is a bit strange and annoying but has a <a href="http://www.thecaribbeanisaband.com/downloads.html">bunch of stuff to download</a>.</p>
