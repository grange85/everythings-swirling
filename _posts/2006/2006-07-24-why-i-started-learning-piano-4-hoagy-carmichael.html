OK - so <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoagy_Carmichael">Hoagy</a> isn't actually playing piano in this clip but seeing him in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037382/">To Have and Have Not</a> - chewing on his toothpick, looking cool and dealing with the sassy Lauren Bacall was another reason I took up the piano.</p>
<p>This clip has Hoagy rattling off a few of his classics and partaking of some uncomfartable badinage with trombonist and bandleader Jack Teagarden</p>
