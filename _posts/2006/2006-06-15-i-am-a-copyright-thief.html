<p>I recently uploaded to youtube a video of <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/galaxie/index.php?article_id=145">Luna playing Lovedust on the Conan O'Brien show</a> from a few years back - and while I am of course NOT the copyright holder and therefore WAS breaking the youtube terms and conditions I thought that as it was a low res video of virtually no resale value (no offence to Luna but they're not going to make NBC a hatful of cash from reselling their performance) and that it is very unlikely that this clip will turn up anywhere officially I couldn't see the harm in bending (OK breaking!) the rules.</p>
<p>Today I received an email from youtube to say that the video had been removed because they had received "third-party notification claiming that this material is infringing". So the video is gone. A video that was...</p>
<ul>
<li>not losing anyone anything</li>
<li>not damaging anyones reputation</li>
<li>providing an opportunity for Luna fans around the world to see something that they couldn't see officially</li></ul>
<p>Copyright fascism is a sad fact of life. I just thought that Luna were far enough below the radar to avoid the interests of the greedy and petulant copyright "owners".</p></p>
