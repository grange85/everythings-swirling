<blockquote><a href="http://www.time.com/time/2006/100albums/index.html">The All-TIME 100 Albums</a><br />
We researched and listened and agonized until we had a list of the greatest and most influential records ever - and then everyone complained because there was no Pink Floyd on it. And that's exactly how it should be</blockquote>
<p>No it's not how it should be at all! It should be sensible and reasoned and not insulting...four of the nine albums from the 2000s are by people who were dead LONG before the 2000s started.</p>
<p>I shan't waste my breath suggesting what's missing but what's included is an embarrassing joke clearly put together by people who clearly know absolutely bloody nothing. Lists like this don't inspire sensible debate and discussion they merely demonstrate that the world doesn't deserve beautiful and insightful music because wankers who write this sort of thing would rather hear a compilation of forty-year old Elvis tracks.</p>
<p>Arseholes!</p></p>
