So this is by way of a "coming out". Latecomer as I was to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>, like a born-again Christian or a reformed smoker I have become fanatical and obsessed. Having said that I am still a minor Buffy nut compared with <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/hazel/">Hazel</a>.</p>
<p>So the two of us are stitting down to watch the entire run again - we manufactured an "excuse" involving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_%28TV_series%29">Angel</a> (which we haven't seen as yet) but to be honest we just wanted to watch it again - and it's not like we have anything else to watch (maybe 30 or 40 films and a few TV series - not really that much).</p>
<p>The most obvious difference this time around seems to be that the storyline, which was the most important thing first time around, has become only a minor player in our enjoyment of the show. The character development and interaction, and mostly the hilarious dialogue are more important - so we can watch an episode like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%2C_Robot..._You%2C_Jane_%28Buffy_episode%29">I, Robot...You, Jane</a> and thoroughly enjoy it despite its woeful plot - the big test for this theory will come with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_Bad_%28Buffy_episode%29">Beer Bad</a>.</p>
<p>Just to prove she's a bigger fan than me Hazel is <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/hazel/?p=51">blogging her thoughts</a> on each episode as we go through it (<a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/hazel/">Let's Fold Scarves</a>). As for me...I'll just remain a detached and cool music snob and continue to whine preciously at the perilous state of the music and media industries...</p>
