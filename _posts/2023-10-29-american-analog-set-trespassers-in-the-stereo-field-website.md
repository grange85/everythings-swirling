I'm rather thrilled that American Analog set have [emerged from a long hibernation with a new album](https://www.amanset.com/), that has been ordered. While I'm waiting for it to arrive I'll reminisce about my past history with them...

At some point in the late 1990s I was introduced to American Analog Set by fans on the Galaxie 500 Mailing List - I hunted down all the releases I could - which at the time was three rather great albums and the _Bliss Out_ EP (that I kind of loved even more). During my scouring of the Internet for information it became clear that Amanset were sorely under-represented in the _fan website_ stakes... so, as that was _my thing_ I felt an urge to remedy that.

So at some point either at the end of 1999 or early in 2000 _Trespassers in the stereo field_ was born, with the following reason printed proudly on the front page.

> It just made me sad that there didn't appear to be a web site dedicated to such a good band - so I built one. My knowledge of American Analog Set has been gleaned from the following sources...

> - the three albums and one ep I own
> - the very VERY limited sleeve notes they contain
> - the few reviews and interviews I've managed to find on the Internet

The news page was even less ambitious "if I had any news about the band this is where it would go".

Over the next three or four years the page expanded somewhat, both in content and width, but I never got as fully involved in the world of Amanset as I was (and still am) in the world of Galaxie 500, so the pages became a little neglected - mostly because my time was being used elsewhere, but also because I wasn't getting a huge amount of engagemnent from other fans - this would have been down to me rather than them! Also, the gaps were being filled elsewhere, other websites started to appear - including an official one - that made it harder for me to commit.

In May 2002, I was already considering closing the site but decided that the band were still not that well served on the Internet so I persisted. In July, the band played at 93 Feet East in London and I went along, the only time I saw them live, I met up with a couple of folk who had contacted me through the website, didn't talk to the band... and that was that. My pal did record the show but I can't find the recording, I was also sent a recording from another UK date, but can't find that either.

I have found a couple of casettes I was sent, one with a couple of live shows from 2000; and one with what's described as "New work 2001" and has the following message inside:

> I have no -idea- about track titles for these. The cd Kenny gave me had no label or titles or anything. Apart from a slightly different mix of "Only Living Boy Around" this is all new work. Be fore warned : This is, as Kenny puts it, the "rock 'n' roll" album. Hee Hee Hee.

I sadly can't remember who sent me this - they filled up the other side with synth-pop band [Vitesse's Chelsea 27099 album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbrvGWU_pIg) which I'll admit to not having listened to for 20+ years! I currently don't have a working cassette deck so the Amanset _New work_ will have to remain a mystery!

On the 5th November 2004 I declared the site dead, and in March 2005 made one last post pointing users at a new fansite [Amansetnews _archived at Wayback Machine (https://web.archive.org_), 4th April 2005](https://web.archive.org/web/20050404222222/http://www.amansetnews.com/) and Amanset's official site, and finally mothballed the site... and eventually took it down.

I have to admit here that I drifted away from the band, and on occasional revisits found them more difficult to love than I had, I think I had changed, the greatness was still there, I just didn't seem to have the patience to commit to them like I had in those early flushes. I'm older now and the love _is_ still there, I think I just needed them to remind me, and maybe this new album has... although it hasn't arrived yet!
