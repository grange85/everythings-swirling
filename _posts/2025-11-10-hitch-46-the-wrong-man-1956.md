I know I'm sort of just writing these for me now, which is probably why I'm now writing this three months after we actually sat down and watched it. But, having got 40+ films into the series it would be a shame not to finish it... after all, it has already been, astonishingly, eleven years in the making.

The Wrong Man is a good film, but perhaps not a good Hitchcock film, not because it's not _good_ but because perhaps it's not _Hitchcock_. Based, apparently fairly closely, on a true story, it's a courtroom drama. without a great deal of drama but quite a lot of courtroom. Henry Fonda is exceptional as Manny and Vera Miles perhaps even moreso as his wife Rose - they both have faces _made_ for a story like this one.

This is not a Hitch film I return to often (last watched in 2010) but probably because it doesn't need to be.

 _Sadly the much relied on **The Hitchcock Zone** has gone offline in the months since we watched [The Man Who Knew Too Much](/swirling/2025/05/21/hitch-45-the-man-who-knew-too-much-1956/) back in May - it was a fabulous resource. Thankfully a lot (but sadly not all) of it can be found in the Wayback Machine._
