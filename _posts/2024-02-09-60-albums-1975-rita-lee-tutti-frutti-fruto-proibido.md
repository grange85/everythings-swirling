OK, I'm breaking my rules for 1975 since I don't have a physical copy of this album but, for the following reasons I'm running with it:

 - The only 1975 albums I already have on LP have either...
   - been blogged about before
   - are by artists that are turning up later in the series
 - I need to look beyond the the UK (10 out of the first 11 posts) and the US (the other one).

The other thing I need to look beyond is very much NOT represented here since this is very, very much a rock and roll album.

Adam was shared a long list of Brazilian music that I thought I should dip into. I did have two Brazilian acts in my 50 albums series, one of which featured Rita Lee, so I still haven't managed to broaden out as far as I should.

Rita was the original singer of rock band Os Mutantes whose [1968 self-titled record](/swirling/2014/01/10/50-albums-1968-os-mutantes-by-os-mutantes/) was in my [50 albums series](/category/50-albums). The album opens with a piano intro to Dançar Prá Não Dançar (Google translate = Dancing to not Dance)  before some nice chunky guitar kicks in with Rita's vocal. It's a little pedestrian and not that inspiring, although some nice synthy swishes towards the end suggest it could have been better.

The album continues with Agora Só Falta Você (Now All I Miss is You) which is livelier, but the album is sounding very _conventional_ 70s rock, which is fine and I like it well enough, but I think I was hoping for something out of the ordinary considering the album's reputation. I read a post that suggested I might do better to listen to Rita's two previous albums so I'll do that some time.

Rita died last year at just 75 from lung cancer. Here is [her obit at the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-65531905)
