A couple more that are here because of films, and in this case specifically Humphrey Bogart films.

### Day 10 / Song #1<br/>Billie Holiday with Teddy Wilson and his Orchestra - Moanin' Low (1937)
Moanin' Low was [heartbreakingly performed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vh8veUgPt8) in [Key Largo (1948)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Largo_(film)) by Gaye (Claire Trevor) after being bullied into it by gangster Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson) on the promise of a drink:

 - "Gimme that drimk now Johnny"
 - "No!"
 - "But you promised"
 - "You were rotten"

... he gets his comeuppance!

This is a 1937 recording with Billie Holiday on vocals which is very, very much **not** _rotten_!

### Day 10 / Song #2<br/>Hoagy Carmichael - Hong Kong Blues (1942/4/6?) ***BONUS 11pt***
This is sung by Cricket (Hoagy Carmichael) in the 1944 Bogie film [To Have and Have Not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Have_and_Have_Not_(film)) - in the film the protaganist is unable to leave Hong Kong because "sweet loco man" won't let him fly away... this is clearly meaningless - in most recordings, including the one I've picked that may be from 1946 the _"unfortunate coloured man"_ is prevented from leaving by "sweet opium" which makes much more sense.
