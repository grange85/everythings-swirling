I'm sort of relieved that this is the last appearance of Grace Kelly in this series because how many times do have to go on about how stunning she was... and I have to in this review because there really wasn't too much beyond Grace (and the Riviera locations) to love about To Catch a Thief.

The story was silly to the point where you just can't care about who the thief is, and what their motivation was - it seems the _Thief_ is the MacGuffin.

There was some fine support from John Williams and Jessie Royce Landis (and sadly less fine from Brigitte Auber, but I'll blame the script/story for that).

The picnic scene is rather lovely - it has Francie (Grace), looking gorgeous, and outwitting the cat - "name me three deciduous trees indiginous to the North West"! Even the "leg or the breast" line suits Francie's sassiness in this scene, and is beautifully thrown away.
