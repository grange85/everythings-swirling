Recently I've found it hard to enjoy music in big sit down venues so despite the long wait (I've had the tickets for six months!) I was a little apprehensive about seeing <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Joanna+Newsom" class="bbcode_artist">Joanna Newsom</a> at the <a href="http://www.last.fm/event/153730" class="bbcode_event">Royal Albert Hall</a>. Ys may be the best album I own and that's the first time I've said that about a non <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Galaxie+500" class="bbcode_artist">Galaxie 500</a> album in a very VERY long time. I'm not sure it can work like that - it exists so far removed from anything else I own that it seems almost ridiculous to set it alongside the indie-guitar music that makes up so much of my listening.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
So anyway I arrived at the RAH just as <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Moore+Brothers" class="bbcode_artist">The Moore Brothers</a> set was finishing up and I opted for the lav and a bottle of water over catching the end of it, I hadn't been all that impressed by what I'd heard on the Internet but should probably give them a bit more of my attention (particularly given Joanna's effusive praise). <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Roy+Harper" class="bbcode_artist">Roy Harper</a> arrived on stage at eight and played through his 1969/1971 album <a title="Roy Harper - Stormcock" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Roy+Harper/Stormcock" class="bbcode_album">Stormcock</a>...it was great to hear and he still has a great voice and presence.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
As an aside, my first introduction to Roy Harper was in the middle of my Heavy Metal phase (probably 80 or 81) and my cousin Clare asked if I could go and buy her <a title="Roy Harper - Bullinamingvase" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Roy+Harper/Bullinamingvase" class="bbcode_album">Bullinamingvase</a>, I guess because it was hard to get a hold of in Cork. I was happy to oblige but equally happy to mock her for listening to such "old" music - I taped it before I passed it on (because I did that with any album that passed through the house). It was probably ten years before I actually listened to it and became aware that my mockery was very poorly placed and that it was me whose blinkered attitude was deserving of mockery.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Anyway, Joanna arrived on stage to a rapturous welcome - I'm still astounded at just how successful she has become - she is, after all, a stunningly individual and unique talent (on an indie label) and that sort of talent doesn't often get recognised (probably Bjork and Kate Bush are the obvious exceptions). She opened with <span class="inlineFlash"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=7,0,0,0" width="13" height="13" id="inlinePlayer" allowNetworking="internal"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="sameDomain" /><param name="FlashVars" value="resourceID=3047721" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><param name="movie" value="http://cdn.last.fm/webclient/inline/1/inlinePlayer.swf" /><param name="quality" value="high" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#ffffff" /><embed src="http://cdn.last.fm/webclient/inline/1/inlinePlayer.swf" quality="high" FlashVars="resourceID=3047721" bgcolor="#ffffff" width="13" height="13" name="inlinePlayer" allowNetworking="internal" wmode="transparent" allowScriptAccess="sameDomain" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" /></object></span><a title="Joanna Newsom - Bridges and Balloons" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Joanna+Newsom/_/Bridges+and+Balloons" class="bbcode_track">Bridges and Balloons</a>, which seems to be the norm, and then played an astounding set including all of <a title="Joanna Newsom - Ys" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Joanna+Newsom/Ys" class="bbcode_album">Ys</a> (not together), a couple from <span title="Unknown album" class="bbcode_unknown">The Milk Eyed Mender</span>, <a title="Joanna Newsom - Colleen" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Joanna+Newsom/_/Colleen" class="bbcode_track">Colleen</a>, a trad song and a new song. High point in a show of astounding highs was <a title="Joanna Newsom - Sawdust and Diamonds" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Joanna+Newsom/_/Sawdust+and+Diamonds" class="bbcode_track">Sawdust and Diamonds</a>. It was great hearing Ys in the stripped back and stunnigly beautiful (four-piece) arrangements it worked so much better than I imagined it would (even if the Ys Street Band EP had given clues...)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
She seemed genuinely in awe of the venue, the audience and particularly of Roy Harper's performance, about which she gushed enthusiastically, which solicited a shouted "you're welcome" from Roy in a box at the back of the hall.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
So apprehension was misplaced, it was an astounding performance. She is a treasure.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Oh and that's now two acts I can cross off <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/grange85/journal/2007/01/29/329280/">My Top 6...bands or artists I've never seen live</a></p>
