<div>Given my answers for <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2010/07/09/30-days-of-buffy-day-4-favourite-female-character/">day 4</a> and <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2010/07/23/30-days-of-buffy-day-18-character-who-didn%e2%80%99t-get-enough-screen-time/">day 18</a> (and even <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2010/07/14/30-days-of-buffy-day-9-favourite-romance/">day 9</a> and <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2010/07/06/30-days-of-buffy-day-1-favorite-season/">day 1</a>) there really is only one answer to this one... it could even have been there on <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2010/07/07/30-days-of-buffy-day-2-favorite-episode/">day 2</a> if my mood had been different when I wrote it...
<p /> Best Willow-centric episode is, of course Doppelgangland - here&#39;re are the two Willows with appropriate "stupid question" faces on.
