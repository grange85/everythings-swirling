Two from absolute masterpieces of film musicals - I'm not even that much of a fan of Gene Kelly, and in fact in both instances there was a song not involving Gene that was in the running - but ultimately these are the gems...

### Day 20 / Song #1<br/>Debbie Reynolds / Gene Kelly / Donald O'Connor - Good Mornin' (from the film [Singin' in The Rain (1952)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singin%27_in_the_Rain))
Of course the title song was in the running, and it was close, but this (and the dance sequence in the film) clinched it.

Judy and Mickey's version from [Babes in Arms](1939) is pretty darn sweet too!

### Day 20 / Song #2<br/>Frank Sinatra / Gene Kelly / Jules Munshin - New York, New York (from the film [On The Town (1949)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Town_(film))
I was tempted by Betty Garrett and Frank Sinatra doing [Come Up to My Place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQj3sbXivYY) but I realised that I liked the sequence more than I liked the song, and really it would be ridiculous to pick it over this...
