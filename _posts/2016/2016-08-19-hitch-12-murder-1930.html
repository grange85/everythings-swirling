<blockquote><p>an interesting film and was quite successful in London. But it was too sophisticated for the provinces.<br />
<footer>Hitchcock (1967) by Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut</footer></blockquote></p>
<p>This is quite the step-up from <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2016/07/28/hitch-11-juno-and-the-paycock-1929/">Hitch #11</a>, the subject matter is more appropriate and means that Hitchcock is clearly more comfortable with being Hitch. </p>
<p>The cast all seem to fit and as we're drawn into the the story and we are also fed little nuggets of humour to offset the tension and mask the occasional clunky dialogue and stiff performances.</p>
<p>Lovely to see Norah Baring again after her appearances in Asquith's silent gems.</p>
<p>Being a sophisticated Londoner I thoroughly enjoyed Murder!</p>
