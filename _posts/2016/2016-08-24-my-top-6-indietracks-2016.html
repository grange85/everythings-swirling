<p>Indietracks was a joy again this year - and with better weather than last year - saw lots of great stuff, missed lots of great stuff too - so a top six is sort of ridiculous... but here you go:</p>
<h2>#1 - Deerful in the Church</h2><br />
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/28718006616/in/album-72157671963692915/" title="Deerful at Indietracks 2016"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7630/28718006616_efe6a7f301_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Deerful at Indietracks 2016"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
The first year we went to Indietracks we never managed to see anything in the church - over the last couple of years we've worked out that going in as a band finishes rather than trying to get in when a band starts is the way - sure you have to wait (although the waiting might include bonus sound-check fun). <a href="https://deerful.com/">Deerful</a> was near the top of my list for Indietracks since I've rather been loving Emma's beautiful voice over beautiful electronic doodling. The set was a treat and finished with a bit of classic Indietracks preaching to the choir with a cover of The Field Mice's Emma's House:<br />

<h2>#2 - Haiku Salut on the main stage</h2><br />
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/28681508161/" title="Haiku Salut accordionists at @indietracks last weekend"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8871/28681508161_e2d21ff382_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" alt="Haiku Salut accordionists at @indietracks last weekend"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
One of the bands we never saw in the church was <a href="https://haikusalut.com/">Haiku Salut</a> who did their lamp show in there a few years back - we stood outside with lots of other folk who never got in. We've been lucky enough to see them quite a few times since (including lamp show performances) - their second album Etch and Etch Deep is just as beautifully hypnotising as the first... and live they are still mesmerising - even in daylight... and without lamps!<br />

<h2>#3 - <a href="http://www.teatimecollective.co.uk/">Teatime Collective</a></h2><br />
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/28929904286" title="Food queue"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8705/28929904286_c07043dbaf_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" alt="Food queue"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
It was the vegan food stall ... turns out it has a name, I didn't realise until I got the picture back. We ate there every day, I never realised how much I could love vegan ice cream!<br />

<h2>#4 - Flowers on the main stage</h2><br />
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/28552806462" title="Another snap from this afternoon&#x27;s wonderful set by Flowers at @indietracks"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8602/28552806462_b1810d5aae_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" alt="Another snap from this afternoon&#x27;s wonderful set by Flowers at @indietracks"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/flowersdomusic/">Flowers</a> don't really get better because they're already there - the sets are differently perfect. Stuck is still the most mesmerising thing and it pretty much silenced the Indietracks field.<br />

<h2>#5 - Lorna in the shed</h2><br />
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/28672388601/" title="Lorna at Indietracks 2016"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8664/28672388601_d93bd0a699_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Lorna at Indietracks 2016"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
Wa, way back when, I came across <a href="http://lornatheband.com/">Lorna</a> and bought some CDs (that's how long ago) - I loved them but somehow didn't notice that while I was discovering other things Lorna were still plugging away releasing more CDs and making beautiful music. So with them opening day three I chose to forego a steam train trip to finally catch up with them live and it was a joy. The stuff I didn't know was as fine as the stuff I did and hearing them play Understanding Heavy Metal was an Indietracks high! No video on YouTube of that - but this'll do!<br />

<h2>#6 - Sitting behind Hazel on the miniature railway</h2><br />
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/moley75/28093065213/in/dateposted/" title="Having fun"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8192/28093065213_88f7bda902_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Having fun"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
To be honest I feel a bit of a plum as a grown man sitting on a miniature railway - I feel it's a tiny step away from grown men commuting on scooters - but I only do it once a year (actually so far once every two years as we missed out somehow last year) - but Hazel loves it - possibly more than anything else at Indietracks. I love that she loves Indietracks as much as I do - and the miniature railway helps with that - and that means we get to go back to the loveliest festival every year.</p>
<h2>Honourable mention - <a href="http://www.bearsuit.co.uk/">Bearsuit</a></h2><br />
...for the weird anxiety of watching a band with the fear that one of their number might give birth at any moment<br />

<h2>Honourable mention #2 - The sunset on day one</h2><br />
