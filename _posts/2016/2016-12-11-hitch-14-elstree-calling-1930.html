I believe Hitch's contribution to Elstree Calling is the unfunny sequences with Gordon Harker trying to fix his <del datetime="2016-12-17T22:58:44+00:00">radio</del><ins datetime="2016-12-17T22:58:44+00:00">telly (obviously, thanks Hazel)</ins>. I'm not sure this gives any noticeable evidence of the genius of Hitchcock. The film is mostly a bore but with a few eye-catching sequences - normally involving dancers and a bit of hand colouring.</p>
