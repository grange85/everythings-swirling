My journey to folk music has been a slow and steady one, there was always elements of folk and especially folk-rock seeping into the glam and rock and metal and indie phases of my life but it was probably Eliza Carthy's 1998 album(s) **Red/Rice** that opened doors into the more traditional elements of English folk music - and mostly because I enjoyed the _Rice_ bit of it more than the _Red_ bit - possibly because, despite being more _traditional_ it was further from my usual folk fare.

I don't remember listening to Anglicana as much as _Rice_ which seems odd because it is even better, I almost said _more enjoyable_ but, not always becaue... folk music

He mixed it with a glass of wine<br>
And gave it to his own true lover<br>
She drank it with a most fearful mind
