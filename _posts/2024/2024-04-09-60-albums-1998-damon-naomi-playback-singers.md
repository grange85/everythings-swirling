Playback Singers was Damon & Naomi's third album it is also...

 - their first without Kramer producing
 - their first recorded "at home"
 - their first album with a [Ghost]() connection
 - their first album with a [Tom Rapp]() connection
 - their only (studio) album that's never had a vinyl release
 - sometimes forgotten

<blockquote>
Playback Singers is a document of the past year and a half of inspiration and experimentation, during which Damon & Naomi recorded, produced, sang and played everything on the record by themselves, alone in their living room

Damon & Naomi composed and performed these songs for an audience consisting solely of their cat (and even she mysteriously disappeared during the recording of the drum tracks).

It really is a beautiful album, maybe their most beautiful album?

I saw Damon & Naomi twice in 1998, both were _difficult_ shows. The first at The Garage was on a bill with Tim Keegan and Mountain Goats and their set was short and the venue was noisy. A good show but not perfect. The second at Dingwalls, which was another venue with too much bar noise and chatter, and also felt a little too big and impersonal for a Damon & Naomi show.
