_I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday - Wizzard (1973)_  
It did seem odd picking a Christmas track although I absolutely love Christmas singles (and glam ones I love most of all) - Wizzard edged out The Wombles by the tiniest of margins! I love the cash register at the beginning, I love the sax (a phrase I very rarely say), and, most of all I love "ok you lot, take it!"
