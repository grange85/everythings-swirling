_All Around My Hat - Steeleye Span (1975)_  
I sometimes find it hard to explain just how much I love Steeleye Span, through pretty much all of their phases. But the Mike Batt phase is my favourite and All Around My Hat is perfect!

I never got to see them live until a couple of years ago when they played the Whitley Bay Playhouse, I was practically in tears during All Around My Hat.

I only recently became aware of Mike Batt's other Steeleye album [Rocket Cottage](/swirling/2024/02/13/60-albums-1976-steeleye-span-rocket-cottage/) recently, and it is also rather great, and maybe if they'd released "The Brown Girl" as a single that might have been in here instead of "Hat".

_Mike Batt puts in his second appearance in this series!_
