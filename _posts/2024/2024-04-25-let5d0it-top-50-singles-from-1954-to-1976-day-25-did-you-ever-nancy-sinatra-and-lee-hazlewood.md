_Did You Ever? - Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood (1971)_  
I guess it's hard not to get _personal_ when picking "the best" and this is probably the most _personal_ of my picks. I could have picked one or more of so many Nancy & Lee tracks and this mightn't be the one I _think_ is the best, but it reminds me of my mum - and her music taste wasn't always great so I love that there is at least one great song to remind me of her!
