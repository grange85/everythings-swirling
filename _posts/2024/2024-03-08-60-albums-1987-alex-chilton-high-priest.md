My Alex Chilton timeline must be approx this...

 - The Letter by The Box Tops - I had a compilation double album called [America's Greatest Hits](https://www.discogs.com/master/1372695-Various-Americas-Greatest-Hits) from the early 70s which I remember being a rather good whizz through US music history from the the 1950s... although... that awful, awful sleeve!
 - [Big Star #1 Record / Radio City](https://www.discogs.com/release/6118796-Big-Star-1-Record-Radio-City) _"2 complete albums on 1 CD"_ - that I bought probably in the late 80s.
 - A bunch of Alex Chilton solo I picked up second hand in various places - [Bach's Bottom](https://www.discogs.com/master/289142-Alex-Chilton-Bachs-Bottom), [Live in London](https://www.discogs.com/master/102085-Alex-Chilton-Live-In-London), [Black List](https://www.discogs.com/master/182946-Alex-Chilton-Black-List) (all on CD) and [The World We Knew](https://www.discogs.com/master/102537-Tav-Falcos-Panther-Burns-The-World-We-Knew) (the Tav Falco's Panther Burns album he played on/produced) and [High Priest](https://www.discogs.com/master/102084-Alex-Chilton-High-Priest) (both on LP). I bought these after my Big Star discovery.
 - Big Star - [Third/Sister Lovers](https://www.discogs.com/release/8073087-Big-Star-Third-Sister-Lovers) and [Live](https://www.discogs.com/master/315988-Big-Star-Live) when Ryko issued them on CD in the early 90s.
 - I saw Big Star live once, at The Clapham Grand in August 1993.

Of those non-Big Star albums the one I listen to most is definitely "High Priest", it's a cracking album, I hadn't listened to it for ages but, when I popped it on this week, it was so familiar - I must have listened to it a lot. Most of the rest of the Chilton solo I had picked up was patchy (although I did also quite like the Panther Burns LP - it obv isn't an Alex Chilton album). But I'd recommend [High Priest](https://alexchilton.bandcamp.com/album/high-priest) to anyone who might not have listened to Alex beyond Big Star.
