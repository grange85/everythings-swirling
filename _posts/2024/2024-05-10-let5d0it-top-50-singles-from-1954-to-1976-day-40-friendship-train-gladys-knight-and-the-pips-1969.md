_Friendship Train - Gladys Knight and The Pips (1969)_  
I could have easily picked the [other GK&TP train song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jboC9-nL0WA) but this clinched becuase what the world *does* need now is love and understanding! Also because of The Pips' moves in this clip! Oh god, I love The Pips so much, and Gladys obv... but... The Pips!!
