_Aquarius / Let The Sunshine In - The Fifth Dimension (1969)_  
This is so amazingly joyous, I tried to watch the film of Hair a while back, it was awful, maybe because it was made ten years too late and just looked like a ridiculous parody. I've no idea if I'd have felt the same about the play in 1969... I hope not.

I do rather love this clip from The Ed Sullivan Show of the Hair cast going full on peace and love...
