Over Christmas in 1974 The Mermaid Theatre in Blackfriars presented "Treasure Island: A Musical Adventure", with Bernard Miles as Long John Silver, Willie Rushton as Squire Trelawney,and, probably significantly for me, Spike Milligan as Ben Gunn.

I was ten years old and had become quite a Spike fan in the previous years which mostly manifested itself by reading books of Goon Show scripts, and occasionally getting lucky enough to hear one on the radio. So, my dad took me to see Spike in Treasure Island, I can only assume that it was my Spike love explains why Helen and Anton weren't invited along.

I remember the show and the trip fairly well considering it's getting on for 50 years ago now, although having this cast album has helped with that. We also had the programme which I was hoping to find tucked into the sleeve but sadly not. The part I remember most is Ben Gunn's cheese song, because it was Spike, and it was funny. The rest of the show is a blur but the songs are enjoyable enough and the story is such a good one!

I suspect this album was bought on the day of the show but can't be sure. It has, shall we say, been rather well _loved_! My care for vinyl has always been (and frankly still is) a little... neglectful at times and since this was given to a ten year old it has had a long time to acquire the skips, pops and crackles that are in evidence.

Here's Spike singing Cheese, as lifted from my well-used copy!
