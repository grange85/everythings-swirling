As this series has made quite clear the early 80s had me far removed from _pop_ and the charts, not that pop completely passed me by because there was still Top of The Pops and in my job before I joined the BBC (in 1984) I used to have Radio 1 on pretty much all day. So I _knew_ pop, I just mostly didnt't really listen to it.

But I sort of _knew_ Eurythmics for the following reasons

 - Annie Lennox was difficult to not look at, such a powerful image.
 - Dave Stewart also, but for different reasons.
 - The Tourists (their previous band) had had a hit with a cover of "I Only Want to Be With You" that was very memorable, as were their TOTP appearances at the time.

Also, their hits as Eurythmics were also pretty memorable and each side of this LP starts with a big hit. _Love is a Stranger_ (UK No.6) on the A-side and the title track (UK No.2) on the B. I was expecting to recognise other tracks but didn't really. But the rest of the album certainly isn't filler. _This Is The House_ would have been a hit too I think, but wasn't. And the cover of Sam & Dave's _Wrap It Up_ is pretty great.

I've been trying to figure out why I like this album when so much pop at the time turned me off. I think it's because it feels a lot more experimental than I expected, there's a lot going on, I particularly like the last track _The City Never Sleeps_ which could easily have gone on for a couple more minutes.

This album is, of course, Hazel's, and there is more Eurythmics in amongst the Es that clearly deserve a listen.
