I loved Movietone yet managed to never get to see them live, which I find sad and puzzling - although my gig-going had tailed off a little by the 21st century I really ought to have caught them before then. This is their fourth and final album, all of which are perfect.

I owned all the albums on CD, because... it was what I was buying back then - but always felt a bit guilty that on the CDs of the first two albums it distincly tells me to "BUY VINYL" - I eventually fixed this a couple of years back when [radio/ON](https://radio-on.co.uk/) found some copies of **The Blossom Filled Streets** and **The Sand and The Stars**, and then their debut was reissued in a lovely double-LP package last year. So I have all their albums except **Day and Night** on LP.

Some of **The Sand and The Stars** was recorded on a beach in Cornwall and the outdoor ambience is probably enough to make it my favourite of theirs (although like all my favourite bands the album I like best is generally the last one I listened to).

The [sleeve is from a pianola roll](https://www.instagram.com/p/CiGExTLIaM_/?img_index=1). My mum and dad had a player piano, and tons of piano rolls, the bellows was torn so it took a lot of effort to get it to play, but it did. I guess it was _moved on_ when my dad moved on... I do miss it though.
