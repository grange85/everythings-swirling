At some point in 1990 Ken arrived at the BBC Film & VT Library and brought with him Irish indie music. We saw a lot of music over the next few years The Stars of Heaven, The Frank & Walters, The Fat Lady Sings, The Fatima Mansions, and A House and Into Paradise. And Brian, obv.

I think these are the only two albums I have by Irish bands from 1990...

A House - I Want Too Much. I saw A House a few times but to be honest don't remember them all that well, the album has its moments but is perhaps a little too _knowing_ and maybe Dave's vocals are a bit too much for a whole album. Although I don't think it grated this time as much as it did in the past. But...

Into Paradise - Under The Water. I enjoyed this more, and it was much more familiar which suggests I listened to it a lot more that I thought I had. I remember swapping all my Into Paradise CDs with Ken for Into Paradise LPs - I think because he wanted CDs rather than because I wanted vinyl. I saw Into Paradise more too, the last time was at LSE, or maybe ULU, with The Would Bees supporting.
