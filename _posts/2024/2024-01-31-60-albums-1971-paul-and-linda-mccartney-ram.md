Anyone who's come across me over the years has probably realised that I'm a bit of a Macca fan, and we're talking Macca both with and beyond The Beatles.

My favourite Paul post-Beatles LP varies by my mood, but RAM is always in the running and here are some reasons

- It's the only album credited to Paul **and** Linda
- It has Uncle Albert / Admiral Halsey - which I love for reasons I can't fully explain - _the butter wouldn't melt so I put it in a pie_ (!?)
- It was (apparently) released on (in the US) or just after (in the UK) my 7th birthday
- It has those sweet films for [Heart of the Country](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGaY-fyZl5M) and [3 Legs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPCpv7wS-gg)
- Back Seat of My Car

Apparently his ex-Beatle band-mates weren't that impressed - although neither Lennon ("muzak to my ears") or Starr ("I don't think there's one good tune") ever managed to make an album this good in their post-Beatles career.
