I managed to not post about Rope when we watched it so here I am throwing together a post about a film I know I didn't really like but over six months since we watched it. Obviously, it is a technical mastepiece but I didn't like the film. Perhaps because there's nothing (apart from the technique) to like about it. Two horrible people perform a horrible act and a horrible professor exposes them.

Nope I didn't like the film, and even the **5** I rated it in retrospect seems a but generous... but maybe I just scored it on technique!?
