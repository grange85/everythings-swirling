In 1977 I was still into ELO, The Who and Neil Young - I was aware of punk, it was hard not to be, but for the most part it passed me by. A couple of years later my sister was going out with a lad nicknamed "Smurf" (I can't remember his _actual_ name) who was also probably too young to be into punk in 1977, but was definitely into it in 1980.

He lent me a bunch of albums including The Great Rock and Roll Swindle and Never Mind The Bollocks. The Great Rock and Roll Swindle was patchy and mostly forgettable - all those rock and roll numbers were better first time round and the album sounded (to me) like a clueless parody of rock and roll music. Never Mind The Bollocks however was the exact opposite! I bought myself this copy around then, second hand, and is the only record by The Sex Pistols I have ever owned, and surely, the only one you need to own.

It genuinely sounds confrontational, and exploitative - I wrote _angry_ at first but I'm not sure there is anger there, it feels more considered than angry - it was surely planned to upset and annoy - so not made in anger? Their targets are considered and score a hit every time.

It still sounds amazing now, and I sort of feel a bit sad that I lived alongside, but not through punk!

The original album was released with 11 tracks missing out Submission, my copy has Submission but you'll notice it's not mentioned on the sleeve - that's not unusual it seems, some have it, some don't.

Anyway... here's the best cover of a Sex Pistols track...
