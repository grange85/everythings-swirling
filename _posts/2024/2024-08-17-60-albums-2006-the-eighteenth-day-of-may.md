The Eighteenth Day of May scratch all my classic folk-rock itches so it's not a surprise that I own and love this album... twice. I bought it on release on CD in 2006, and bought the lovely double LP in 2020.

I ought to be sad that this was all they released, but fortunately the various members have kept putting out enough lovely music since... 

 - Alison Cotton and Mark Nicholas as [The Left Outsides](https://theleftoutsides.bandcamp.com/), who'll likely crop up later in this series.
 - Alison (also) has lots of [lovely and varied solo releases](https://theleftoutsides.bandcamp.com/album/are-you-sure-i-was-there) (although, hopefully there'll be more from The Left Outsides - because I miss them).
 - Allison Brice as the voice of [Lake Ruth](https://lakeruth.bandcamp.com/music), who will also probably turn up later.
 - Ben Phillipson, Mark and Alison as [Trimdon Grange Explosion](https://borleyrectory.bandcamp.com/album/trimdon-grange-explosion).
 - Ben also released the lovely [Moonrider](https://borleyrectory.bandcamp.com/album/moonrider) a couple of years back.
 - Richard Olsen as a member of [The See See]() and [The Hanging Stars]() _both of whom are now on my **todo** list_

I sadly never got to see The Eighteenth Day of May live, but I've just come across this gorgeous video of them at the 12 Bar Club in Denmark Street, in 2005 which makes me both happy, that it exists,... and sad, that I wasn't there.
