_Snow Queen - The City (1968)_  
Despite having long loved Carole King I only discovered The City relatively recently, although I added it to a Spotify playlist over 10 years ago. Once upon a time 10 years was an age, now it feels like yesterday. Anyway, the idea of Carole in a _band_ was quite exciting and the album is a treat.

_I know the pic is not really appropriate, being Carole solo, and in 1972, but... it is rather lovely._
