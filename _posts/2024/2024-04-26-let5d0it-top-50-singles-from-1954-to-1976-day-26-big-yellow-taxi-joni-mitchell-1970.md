_Big Yellow Taxi - Joni Mitchell (1970)_  
A wonderful environmental anthem even if, when I first heard it in the early 70s I wasn't sure what a _parking lot_ was, didn't know what _D.D.T._ was, and even now am unsure why Joni's _old man_ was taken off in a _big yellow taxi_. Also... 54 years on why are we still fucking up our planet?
