I was never really that big a fan of The Wedding Present, they seemed a little too bloke-y for my tastes (although maybe that was more about the audience than the band or music?) - but I sort of knew they were _good_ so 1998's Va Va Voom with its more orchestral and mellower sound was a lovely revelation. By their second album however things seemed to already slipping back to more traditional David Gedge territory - although not quite there - it was still a lovely indiepop record, as was 2002's Torino.

I saw Cinerama a few times over the years - and the shows sort of followed that pattern, the later ones were almost indistinguishable from a Wedding Present gig. I was already bemoaning the drift back to sounding like TWP by 2002. 

The last time was at Indietracks in 2015 and, maybe because of the festival, it felt closer to the Cinerama I fell in love with.

I do rather love Disco Volante, but will inevitably listen to Va Va Voom first.



_Sorry that this series rather tooka back seat, and this post is a little half-arsed... I'll try and do better!_
