Nord Express are another band I got to know and love thanks to the Galaxie 500 Mailing list, someone sent me a cassette of their music back in the late 90s - as always I can't remember who, there's a chance it might even have been band member Ron, who was on the list.

{% ahfowimage "https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53630652187_3e448d0839_c.jpg" "Nord Express - Nord Express (Slumberland, 1996)" "https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/53630652187/in/dateposted/" %}

This is their first album, or EP [as Slumberland described it](https://slumberlandrecords.com/catalog/show/26) but 27 minutes long, so... album! It's very obvious why someone would think that me, a Galaxie 500 fan, would love Nord Express, and their first release is beautiful and has the bonus of some vocal augmentations from indiepop legend Pam Berry.

In the early 2000s I got an idea to get the Galaxie 500 Mailing list to get together a tribute album, but, being me it was poorly organised and took far too long to get out there and ended up being 50 or 60 home-burned CDs with laser printed sleeve - Ron Harrity of Nord Express contributed a lovely version of Galaxie 500's Cold Night for the release. It deserved a wider release. I did sneak it as a bonus track on [On Fire 30](https://aheadfullofwishes.bandcamp.com/album/on-fire-30) many years later.

You can download the tribute album for free here:
 - [Decomposing - a fan tribute to Galaxie 500 and Luna](https://static.fullofwishes.co.uk/galaxie_list_tribute/)

On Fire 30, and its follow up This Music is Ours are both available for pay what you want on Bandcamp - although Bandcamp's _no covers_ policy means that they may not be there forever, so... grab them while you can:
 - [On Fire 30](https://aheadfullofwishes.bandcamp.com/album/on-fire-30)
 - [This Music is Ours](https://aheadfullofwishes.bandcamp.com/album/this-music-is-ours)

Nord Express released another, also lovely, album [Central](https://slumberlandrecords.com/catalog/show/14) and a compilation [Loveland 1995-2005](https://www.discogs.com/release/4701591-Nord-Express-Loveland-1995-2005), Ron still (occasionally) makes music with [An Anderson](https://ananderson.bandcamp.com/).

_Ugh! Getting a bit left behind on this series so it's unlikely to finish before I reach 60... I guess we'll have to blame [#LET5D0IT](/swirling/category/let5d0it/)._
