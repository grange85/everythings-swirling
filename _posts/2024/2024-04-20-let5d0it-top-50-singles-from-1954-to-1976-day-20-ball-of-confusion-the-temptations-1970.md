_Ball of Confusion (That's What the World is Today) - The Temptations (1970)_  
In the mid-80s I bought a Telstar compilation of [The Temptations Greatest Hits](https://www.discogs.com/release/2326720-The-Temptations-Greatest-Hits) that had one of the worst sleeves in my record collection ~ but so many of their _Greatest Hits_ could have found a place in my 50!
