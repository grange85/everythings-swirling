I bought _Future Pilot AKA vs A Galaxie of Sound_ on eBay - the seller described it as being in _VG_ condition which it most certainly was not, the cover was water stained and torn, I complained to no avail and ultimately couldn't be arsed because I did actually want it, I just paid over the odds for it.

The album is 2 CDs of "ongoing collaborations" between Future Pilot AKA and "artists from all around the world" and has lots of great stuff on it. Each track has a synthsized voice introducing it which does get a little annoying after a while but the rest does make up for that annoyance.

I bought this a few years after release, and I think it was primarily to fill out my _National Park_ collection - not a huge collection. You can here an [extract from the Future Pilot AKA vs National Park](https://nationalpark.bandcamp.com/album/sterling) on the National Park Bandcamp. The track is called "Sterling" and was "<S-F2>recorded with after the death of Velvet Underground guitarist Sterling Morrison's death.

The [National Park Bandcamp](https://nationalpark.bandcamp.com/music) also claims that there'll be "a new album early 2024, honest" although we're running out of "early" in 2024. They have come out of hibernation and recently supported Gerry Love at a couple of dates in Glasgow that sadly I didn't get to. Hopefully a new album will get them playing as far south as Newcastle!
