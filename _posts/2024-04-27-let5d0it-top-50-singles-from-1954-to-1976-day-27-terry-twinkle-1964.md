_Terry - Twinkle (1964)_  

{% ahfowvideo "cVuho5gJy_8" "Terry - Twinkle (1964)" "https://cdn.grange85.co.uk/images/terry-twinkle.jpg" %}

"They should go clear their ears out at 'Ready Steady Go.' They must listen to what the lyrics say. The girl in the song pleads with the boy to be careful. __It's a plea for road safety__" (_my emphasis_) from The Daily Mirror, 28th November 1964.

Another [teenage tragedy song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_tragedy_song) in my list... and not the last! It has a naive charm and sounds like it was written by a 16 year old girl... which it was.
