So in 2020 we stayed in... a lot - and I watched a lot of films - more than in any year since I've been keeping a log (and I can't imagine any year before then when I saw more). Here's a quick summary.

- I watched 389 films
- The average score of the films I watched was 5.89 / 10
- I saw 0.79% of them on the big screen
- and watched almost a quarter of them on Talking Pictures TV
- 57% of the films I watched were from before I was born
- 7 were animated and 31 were musicals
- 88.9% of films were in English  
  other langugaes:
   - Bengali (1)
   - Polish (2)
   - Japanese (2)
   - Arabic (4)
   - Telegu (1)
   - Finnish (1)
   - French (10)
   - Russian (1)
   - German (1)
   - Hindi (8)
   - Spanish (2)
   - Silent (8)


All the films I rated ten were films I'd seen before

- A Matter of Life and Death (1946)
- Underground (1928) _that was one of the three on the big screen film!_
- Ice Cold in Alex (1958)
- Black Narcissus (1947)
- Some Like It Hot (1959)

The highest rated film I'd not seen before was 
 - Cairo Station (1958, Youssef Chahine) _which got a nine_
