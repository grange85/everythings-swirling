Ten years ago today I took my dad (well, he took me) to see Dean & Britta playing Galaxie 500 in Brighton:

We turned up early and watched the soundcheck

![Dad checkd the merch table while Britta soundchecks](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2LvOfRYqyc9ya_NbOYXX28sX_vN1nEp_BJhg2Fx4QRJpPT413iPxdz0kVyiigvW8HQXmKR_GAjMxUERV-2ZlhMgavJHVoKH4EoQ6X929OjjK267nhIJCTUSwBGfB2L_O59vT2A3xzu0=w2400)

The show was lovely - [I wrote about it at the time on <abbr title="A Head Full of Wishes">AHFoW</abbr>](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2011/02/17/review-dean-wareham-plays-galaxie-500-in-brighton/) 

> Soundcheck over, dad scrounged a beer, told Britta her hat looked silly and told Dean about seeing Bill Haley and the Comets… I stood by, quiet and uncomfortable!

They finished the set with a storming Ceremony:

Dean wrote about my in his blog at the time

> Andy Aldridge brought his Dad along to the show and we enjoyed meeting him. Andy’s Dad told me after the show that I should let Britta sing more and it’s true she has a lovely voice.

... and mentioned it during one of last year's livestreamed shows ... so, it seems my dad made an impression!?
