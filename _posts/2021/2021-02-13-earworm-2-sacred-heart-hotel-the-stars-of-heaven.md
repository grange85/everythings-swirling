This morning I awoke to find the lovely Sacred Heart Hotel washing around inside my head - it's been a while:

I saw The Stars of Heaven just once - Ken took me (or more accurately made me take him) along to The Mean Fiddler in Harlesden for what I suspect was their last show ~ or at least their last London show - I guess sometime in 1990?

I have a copy of Sacred Heart Hotel picked up from a Record and Tape Exchange and that was all I knew ~ until a few years ago when they put both albums on the internet for free.

Now you can [hear them on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/03Up66Zd0A48MVVqOpMat2?si=BABn_5muTGCWX8E-hdD3CQ)

Nice clip of them playing [Every Other Day (from their second album) on Anything Goes](https://www.rte.ie/archives/2020/1013/1171249-the-stars-of-heaven/)
