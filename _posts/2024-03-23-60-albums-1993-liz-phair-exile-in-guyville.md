I listened to Exile in Guyville a lot back in the day, and the two follow ups Whip Smart and Whitechocolatespaceegg a little less because they were a little less great. I was unaware of the Galaxie 500 mention in Stratford on Guy when I bought this, so the album is in my collection for legitimate reasons not completist fan reasons... although, a _Galaxie 500_ mention on an album that slowly crept its way into the mainstream is quite exciting.

It's still a great album, maybe not the [56th greatest album of all time](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/liz-phair-exile-in-guyville-4-1063177/) but pretty strong all the same.

I don't think I ever saw Liz live, although there's a nagging concern that I did and have forgotten!?
