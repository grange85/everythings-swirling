<meta name="description" content="Tagged a while back by maurinsky (via Hazel) This is tricky, mostly tricky because of all I&#39;ve had to leave out (two Galaxie 500 albums for starters). On Fire - Galaxie 500 (1989)Best album ever. Nothing more to say (except that its appearance in this list also represents the band&#39;s entire output and that of Luna, Damon &amp; Naomi and Dean &amp; Britta Ys - Joanna Newsom (2006)Stunningly ambitious and beautifully realised and one day you all will realise just how perfect a piece of art this is. Secret Name - Low (1999)I normally pick &quot;I Could Live in Hope&quot; as my fave Low album, but Secret Name is beautiful and is (according to last.fm) the Low album I listen to more than any other. The Velvet Underground - The Velvet Underground (1969)The third VU album is awesome and the contrast between this and White Light/White Heat just makes it better (that doesn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t love White Light/White Heat). Hounds of Love - Kate Bush (1985)Hounds of Love was my by-myself album of choice for a long time. Listening now it&#39;s remarkable as well in that it manages to not suffer from the time it was made. Previously on Everything&#39;s Swirling. If You&#39;re Feeling Sinister - Belle &amp; Sebastian (1996)Just really sweet pop. Previously on Everything&#39;s Swirling. Horses - Patti Smith (1975)Whenever I listen to this album I&#39;m stunned I don&#39;t listen to it more. All the places on this list with the exception of the first two are vulnerable from attack from Motorhead, Brian, Nina Nastasia, Throwing Muses, Stereolab, Yo La Tengo or any one of hundreds of others. THE RULES: 1. Post your list of the seven best albums, the seven bloggers you will tag, a copy of these rules, and a link back to this page.2. Each person tagged will put a URL to their Blogger Album Project post along with a list of the seven best albums in the comment section HERE at Hill&rsquo;s Country. Enough already!3. Feel free to post the &ldquo;I Contributed to the Blogger Album Project&rdquo; Award Graphic on your sidebar, along with a link back to this page.4. Post a link back to the blogger who tagged you.&lt;/strong&gt; As before...if you read this consider yourself tagged. &lt;/p&gt;" />
