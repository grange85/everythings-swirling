<meta name="description" content="Jesse Sykes I was so tired yesterday and tempted to give this concert a miss in favour of an early night...except I never have early nights and would have stayed up until 1am anyway with nothing to show for my late night. I arrived in Kilburn about 7:30, the only bike rack near the venue had two sawn through U-Locks as evidence that leaving your bike unattended in Kilburn is probably unwise. I took a chance although I locked to a lamp-post as the bike rack was clearly bad luck! Entered the lovely Luminaire, grabbed a bottle of water and waited for an hour in the too dingy to read light for Jesse Sykes to come on. Jesse performed with an electric guitarist, Phil, who I guess is &quot;the Sweet Hereafter&quot; for this tour. She proclaimed her shaky nervousness but managed to get through a short sweet set with neither her fingers nor her rich voice letting her down (I keep wanting to describe her voice as &quot;smoky&quot; but I think I&#39;m being influenced by the album sleeve picture of her smoking) Marissa Nadler Marissa Nadler came on to the stage which was set up with her three microphone - one normal, one with a bit of echo and one with a stack of echo (she picked the wrong one for between song banter a couple of times). Sometimes it seemed as if she might just be a normal, sweet, folkie singer-songwriter but then she&#39;d do something that made you realise that she was just a bit special, a lovely &quot;Diamond Heart&quot;, or &quot;Rachel&quot; which despite her commenting on the missing &quot;acid leads&quot; of Greg Weeks still had enough going on with the one acoustic guitar that it really didn&#39;t matter. The bike was still chained to the lamp-post when I got out - obviously the fact that it&#39;s knackered (looking) and grubby, and the saddle is taped up with masking tape to keep the insides inside meant that the theives took their saws and bolt-cutters elsewhere. The ride home was a joy, mostly downhill, wind at my back and not too many other road users getting in the way! &lt;/p&gt;" />

<p>Entered the lovely Luminaire, grabbed a bottle of water and waited for an hour in the too dingy to read light for <a href="http://www.jessesykes.com/">Jesse Sykes</a> to come on. Jesse performed with an electric guitarist, Phil, who I guess is "the Sweet Hereafter" for this tour.
