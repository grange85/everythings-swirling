<meta name="description" content="My dad used to volunteer at the local St John&#39;s Ambulance book sales and for a while in the late 70s and early 80s you&#39;d always find a pile of records at these sales that had clearly been donated by some local, music industry insider. Stacks of unplayed promos and, being a St John&#39;s Ambulance sale, I was probably the only person under 50 and therefore got the opportunity to plough through and fill my boots without any competition. A flick through my record collection even now would reveal a fair few with &quot;Promo only - not for resale&quot; stickers. One such record was a 7&quot; single of She&#39;s A Windup/Baby Jane by Dr Feelgood and, like a fair few of the records I got from the sales, it went a good many weeks unplayed. A school friend was a huge Feelgood fan and so I offered it to him because he would obviously appreciate it more. He said he would gladly take it off my hands but insisted that before I even thought about giving it away that I really ought to listen to it so I went home that afternoon and had another one of those life-changing moments - the awesome opening guitar riff just blew me away...I still have the single and treasure it. Suddenly I was a Feelgood fan and ploughed backwards through their catalogue, went to gigs (well into the 80s) and discovered Wilko Johnson (who had left the band before I discovered them) and saw him even more and even longer. Even now I occasionally dip my feet into that river and get a buzz that is more than just nostalgia. Be Seeing You probably isn&#39;t my favourite Feelgood album, the lyrical obsession with sex gets tiresome and borderline misogynistic (moreso than on any of the other albums) most notably I guess in the song that got me into them. Some of the songs are pedestrian or formulaic (&quot;That&#39;s It, I Quit&quot;, &quot;Sixty Minutes of Your Love&quot;, &quot;As Long as the Price is Right&quot;) but in Windup, &quot;Looking Back&quot; and &quot;Baby Jane&quot; there is so much energy and thrill that I understand what happened to me when I put on that single all those years ago. &lt;/param&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;/embed&gt; &lt;/p&gt; A few years later my life was changed again by a record I found at the St John&#39;s Ambulance sales...REM&#39;s Reckoning." />

  <h1>Just dug this one out #21 - Be Seeing You by Dr Feelgood</h1>

  <p>My dad used to volunteer at the local <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._John_Ambulance">St John's Ambulance</a> book sales and for a while in the late 70s and early 80s you'd always find a pile of records at these sales that had clearly been donated by some local, music industry insider. Stacks of unplayed promos and, being a St John's Ambulance sale, I was probably the only person under 50 and therefore got the opportunity to plough through and fill my boots without any competition. A flick through my record collection even now would reveal a fair few with "Promo only - not for resale" stickers.</p>
<p>One such record was a 7" single of She's A Windup/Baby Jane by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Feelgood_(band)">Dr Feelgood</a> and, like a fair few of the records I got from the sales, it went a good many weeks unplayed. A school friend was a huge Feelgood fan and so I offered it to him because he would obviously appreciate it more. He said he would gladly take it off my hands but insisted that before I even thought about giving it away that I really ought to listen to it so I went home that afternoon and had another one of those life-changing moments - the awesome opening guitar riff just blew me away...I still have the single and treasure it.</p>
<p>Suddenly I was a Feelgood fan and ploughed backwards through their catalogue, went to gigs (well into the 80s) and discovered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilko_Johnson">Wilko Johnson</a> (who had left the band before I discovered them) and saw him even more and even longer.
