<meta name="description" content="From Our Living Room... I loved From Our Living Room to Yours when I first got hold of it...so much so that I made a web page dedicated to The American Analog Set. In those early days of the Web that was a legitimate way of declaring love...well it was for me anyway I remember listening on headphones to the adorable opening of Magnificent Seventies and being totally sucked in. But I stopped listening to Amanset - I kept buying the albums but stopped listening to them, I stopped updating the website and when Amanset finally called it a day it was frankly a bit of a relief. It turns out that I probably never really loved them at all - and maybe all I really, truly loved was the first 9 minutes of this album...and even that at a push...lets say the first 4 minutes... And listening now I&#39;m beginning to see why, I&#39;m fond of drone and (clearly) not averse to gentle pace but something is missing, something that could pull this out of &quot;nice&quot; and into &quot;gripping&quot; something that could prevent the word B-O-R-I-N-G from popping into my head...but it keeps popping in. Maybe sometimes it almost pulls me back in but then it lets me go again and I drift away thinking of other things and not really hearing the music anymore. Maybe it&#39;s me, maybe I don&#39;t have the patience and skill required to enjoy this music anymore. &lt;/p&gt;" />
