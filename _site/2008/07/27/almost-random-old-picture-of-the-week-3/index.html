After threats from a local farmer Scrapper was &quot;given to the laundry man&quot; which Helen and I assumed was a euphemism for being put down and it was only many years later that we discovered that he really had been given to a laundry man! Yesterday we visited Ju and Mary to meet the kitten that would become our new family member in a few weeks time. Penny will have a cat-like existence by default and Hanwell doesn&#39;t have too many farm animals to terrorize. &lt;/p&gt; Hazel meets Pennyoriginally uploaded by grange85 More pictures of Penny and her family on Flickr &lt;/p&gt;" />
