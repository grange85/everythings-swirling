<meta name="description" content="50,000 little piggies!originally uploaded by Mr. Mark I had decided that my 50,000th track played on last.fm would be carefully chosen and played (just for myself obviously) with a little bit of a celebration. Today I noticed that the Billy Bragg track I was playing was number 50,027 and that the time for celebration had passed. Counting backwards it appears that it passed last night just before I went to bed when I played the new Low xmas single Santa&#39;s Coming Over, that I&#39;d nabbed from some blog somewhere...it wasn&#39;t very good, far too harsh and lacking in melody, not sweet like most of their very wonderful Christmas EP from a few years back. &lt;/p&gt; Oh well - maybe I&#39;ll be more on the ball when I hit 100000. &lt;/p&gt; You can listen to the whole of Low&#39;s good Christmas record on last.fm for free &lt;/p&gt;" />

<p>I had decided that my 50,000th track played <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/grange85">on last.fm</a> would be carefully chosen and played (just for myself obviously) with a little bit of a celebration. Today I noticed that the Billy Bragg track I was playing was number 50,027 and that the time for celebration had passed. Counting backwards it appears that it passed last night just before I went to bed when I played the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Low/_/Santa%27s+Coming+Over">new Low xmas single Santa's Coming Over</a>, that I'd nabbed from some blog somewhere...it wasn't very good, far too harsh and lacking in melody, not sweet like most of their very wonderful Christmas EP from a few years back.</p></p>
<p>Oh well - maybe I'll be more on the ball when I hit 100000.</p></p>
