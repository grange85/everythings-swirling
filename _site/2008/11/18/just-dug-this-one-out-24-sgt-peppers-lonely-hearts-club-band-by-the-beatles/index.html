<meta name="description" content="Sgt. Pepper&#39;s Lonely Hearts Club Band 1967 I&#39;ve always been most fond of the transitionary era of The Beatles and for many years have proclaimed Rubber Soul and Revolver as my two favourite albums, and that the band&#39;s pinnacle was the Strawberry Fields/Penny Lane single. The proclamation would normally have been followed by a dismissive sneer at Sgt. Pepper and pretty much all their subsequent albums. My thinking was that with Pepper they threw all their ideas and imaginings into a bloody great bucket which was then stirred and stirred into an over-rated mess that left them pretty much bereft of any pop sensibility for the rest of the band&#39;s existence. The rest of their career was spent churning out tiresome rock music (with a rare treat here and there) until they, thankfully for all of us, imploded. &lt;/p&gt; Having Ian MacDonald&#39;s awesome Revolution in the Head in the toilet for a couple of months urged me to reassess that position. My opinion was so firmly entrenched that it turned out that Sgt. Pepper was the only Beatles album we hadn&#39;t bought on CD. Having acquired a digital copy I gave the album a listen for the first time in probably 10+ years. And here I am, and nothing is tempting me to change my position. The opening track is a great opener but the unbearable run up to Fixing A Hole is a section that I have no desire to suffer ever again. She&#39;s Leaving Home is the one pop gem in amongst all that cacophonous/pretentious/smug/silly nonsense. &lt;/p&gt; I never had the opportunity of hearing the album in 1967 and it may well have been stunning on first release but without that, I can hear nothing but a confused and confusing muddle that just reaffirms my position that The Beatles started their very steep downward slide with Sgt. Pepper and for me there&#39;s no Beatles-related release worth more than a cursory listen until McCartney&#39;s first solo album &lt;/p&gt; A Day in the Life is astonishing but it doesn&#39;t change my opinion of the album because it sits bolted onto the end after the reprise of Sgt. Pepper&#39;s Lonely Hearts Club Band. That, and the fact that it succeeds where so much of the album fails, gives the impression that it&#39;s not a part of Sgt. Pepper and the fact that it shares vinyl with it is merely chance. &lt;/p&gt; Actually I think I&#39;ll declare that A Collection of Beatles Oldies is my favourite Beatles album - just for contrariness, for the timing of its release and because I picked up a beautiful copy of it in a second hand shop while on holiday in Jersey in 1984 for a quid. &lt;/p&gt;" />
