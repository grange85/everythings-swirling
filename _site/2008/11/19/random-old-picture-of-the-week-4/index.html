I pretty much remember only two things from primary school... &lt;/p&gt; My glasses getting run over by a school bus. Actually I&#39;m a little puzzled that I don&#39;t have my glasses on in this photo - I wore them all the time, so I suppose vanity or the photographer made me take them off - I&#39;m inclined to go with the latter. Helen getting left behind on her first day because she didn&#39;t know to get on the bus and Anton and I getting a serious telling off for our negligence. She was brought home by a teacher. I recall being outraged that we got told off because of Helen&#39;s stupidity - what a lovely caring big brother I was! &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;" />
