<p>Last year I started a tradition to <a href="http://blog.fullofwishes.co.uk/2007/01/02/the-new-year/">post about the New Year every new year</a> but it's only <a href="http://www.bradleysalmanac.com/2008/01/vinyl-to-mp3-bedheads-last-song.htm">this post on the always excellent Bradley's Almanac</a> that reminded me of that tradition. So here it is, a bit late but my new year post about the new year.</p></p>
<p>Last year I wrote "album #3 is LONG LONG overdue" which still applies but Brad reckons that it'll put in an appearance this year - I shan't hold my breath!</p></p>
