  <h1>Thomas the Rhymer</h1>

  <p>Two facts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hazel has family who live in Melrose, so we have visited and stayed in the town many times over the years.</li>
  <li>Steeleye Span’s <em>Now We Are Six</em> has been a favourite Span album of mine for many years (pre-dating my metal and indie phases), and Thomas the Rhymer is the best track on it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Until earlier this year those facts were, in my mind, completely unrelated. Then I learned that the <em>Huntley Bank</em> on which <em>True</em> Thomas encountered <em>a lady gay</em> was in Melrose. And the tree under which he sat that fateful day when he met the Queen of the Fairies has been commemorated by a stone erected by the <em>Melrose Literary Society</em> in 1929.</p>

<p>So today, since we were visiting Hazel’s family we also visited the site of Thomas the Rhymer’s encounter.</p>
