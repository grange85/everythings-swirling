<meta name="description" content="Indietracks was a joy again this year - and with better weather than last year - saw lots of great stuff, missed lots of great stuff too - so a top six is sort of ridiculous... but here you go: #1 - Deerful in the Church The first year we went to Indietracks we never managed to see anything in the church - over the last couple of years we’ve worked out that going in as a band finishes rather than trying to get in when a band starts is the way - sure you have to wait (although the waiting might include bonus sound-check fun). Deerful was near the top of my list for Indietracks since I’ve rather been loving Emma’s beautiful voice over beautiful electronic doodling. The set was a treat and finished with a bit of classic Indietracks preaching to the choir with a cover of The Field Mice’s Emma’s House: #2 - Haiku Salut on the main stage One of the bands we never saw in the church was Haiku Salut who did their lamp show in there a few years back - we stood outside with lots of other folk who never got in. We’ve been lucky enough to see them quite a few times since (including lamp show performances) - their second album Etch and Etch Deep is just as beautifully hypnotising as the first… and live they are still mesmerising - even in daylight… and without lamps! #3 - Teatime Collective It was the vegan food stall … turns out it has a name, I didn’t realise until I got the picture back. We ate there every day, I never realised how much I could love vegan ice cream! &lt;/p&gt; #4 - Flowers on the main stage Flowers don’t really get better because they’re already there - the sets are differently perfect. Stuck is still the most mesmerising thing and it pretty much silenced the Indietracks field. #5 - Lorna in the shed Wa, way back when, I came across Lorna and bought some CDs (that’s how long ago) - I loved them but somehow didn’t notice that while I was discovering other things Lorna were still plugging away releasing more CDs and making beautiful music. So with them opening day three I chose to forego a steam train trip to finally catch up with them live and it was a joy. The stuff I didn’t know was as fine as the stuff I did and hearing them play Understanding Heavy Metal was an Indietracks high! No video on YouTube of that - but this’ll do! #6 - Sitting behind Hazel on the miniature railway To be honest I feel a bit of a plum as a grown man sitting on a miniature railway - I feel it’s a tiny step away from grown men commuting on scooters - but I only do it once a year (actually so far once every two years as we missed out somehow last year) - but Hazel loves it - possibly more than anything else at Indietracks. I love that she loves Indietracks as much as I do - and the miniature railway helps with that - and that means we get to go back to the loveliest festival every year.&lt;/p&gt; Honourable mention - Bearsuit …for the weird anxiety of watching a band with the fear that one of their number might give birth at any moment Honourable mention #2 - The sunset on day one &lt;/p&gt;" />

<p>Indietracks was a joy again this year - and with better weather than last year - saw lots of great stuff, missed lots of great stuff too - so a top six is sort of ridiculous... but here you go:</p>
<h2>#1 - Deerful in the Church</h2><br />

The first year we went to Indietracks we never managed to see anything in the church - over the last couple of years we've worked out that going in as a band finishes rather than trying to get in when a band starts is the way - sure you have to wait (although the waiting might include bonus sound-check fun). <a href="https://deerful.com/">Deerful</a> was near the top of my list for Indietracks since I've rather been loving Emma's beautiful voice over beautiful electronic doodling. The set was a treat and finished with a bit of classic Indietracks preaching to the choir with a cover of The Field Mice's Emma's House:<br />

Wa, way back when, I came across <a href="http://lornatheband.com/">Lorna</a> and bought some CDs (that's how long ago) - I loved them but somehow didn't notice that while I was discovering other things Lorna were still plugging away releasing more CDs and making beautiful music.

<h2>#6 - Sitting behind Hazel on the miniature railway</h2><br />
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/moley75/28093065213/in/dateposted/" title="Having fun"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8192/28093065213_88f7bda902_b.jpg" alt="Having fun"></a><br />

To be honest I feel a bit of a plum as a grown man sitting on a miniature railway - I feel it's a tiny step away from grown men commuting on scooters - but I only do it once a year (actually so far once every two years as we missed out somehow last year) - but Hazel loves it - possibly more than anything else at Indietracks. I love that she loves Indietracks as much as I do - and the miniature railway helps with that - and that means we get to go back to the loveliest festival every year.</p>
<h2>Honourable mention - <a href="http://www.bearsuit.co.uk/">Bearsuit</a></h2><br />
...for the weird anxiety of watching a band with the fear that one of their number might give birth at any moment<br />
