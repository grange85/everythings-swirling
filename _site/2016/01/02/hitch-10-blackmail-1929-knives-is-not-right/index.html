<meta name="description" content="Hitch and Anny on the sound stage of Blackmail Blackmail was Hitch&#39;s last silent and first sound film - we watched both. I first saw the silent Blackmail when it was restored and shown at the BFI in 2012 - it was a revelation - Hitch made the film&#39;s lack of sound work brilliantly - and joy of silent film is that the non-silence of it (the music) becomes such an important part of watching the film - and the person making the music is not only an accompanist but also part of the creative process of making the film... so the film is almost still a work in progress - here&#39;s a lengthy article by Neil Brand on scoring Blackmail. The silent film is splendid - it builds suspense and Anny makes Alice looks truly scared and scarred by things. The sound film is pretty good too - it has some bits of genius of course, famously the brilliant &quot;... blah blah blah blah knife blah blah blah KNIFE ...&quot; scene - but it more often suffers from its sound - most noticeably the ridiculous live dubbing of Anny Ondra.

Blackmail was Hitch's last silent <strong>and</strong> first sound film - we watched both.</p>
<p>I first saw the silent Blackmail when it was restored and shown at the BFI in 2012 - it was a revelation - Hitch made the film's lack of sound work brilliantly - and joy of silent film is that the non-silence of it (the music) becomes such an important part of watching the film - and the person making the music is not only an accompanist but also part of the creative process of making the film... so the film is almost still a work in progress - here's a <a href="http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/sightsound/working-with-hitch">lengthy article by Neil Brand on scoring Blackmail</a>.</p>
<p>The silent film is splendid - it builds suspense and Anny makes Alice looks truly scared and scarred by things.</p>
<p>The sound film is pretty good too - it has some bits of genius of course, famously the brilliant "... blah blah blah blah knife blah blah blah KNIFE ..." scene - but it more often suffers from its sound - most noticeably the ridiculous live dubbing of Anny Ondra.</p>
