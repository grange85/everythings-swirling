<meta name="description" content="I&#39;ve barely come to terms with Lemmy&#39;s passing... and now this. It&#39;s hard to comprehend how ingrained in my growing up Bowie&#39;s music was. He was one of those few artists who spanned my listening from as early as I remember - I guess that&#39;s why it feels weird. I have memories of talking about him at school the day after a TOTP appearance. I was nine or ten, I remember talking about Bowie and The Sweet and T-Rex at school. I heard about Bowie&#39;s death when I got up this morning. I didn&#39;t play any Bowie until this afternoon. I needed time. With Lemmy it was different, I went straight to the records. I played Life on Mars first, I&#39;d picked it a few years back as one of my top 6 from my childhood. Later on Radio 2 Rick Wakeman played it on a piano - that was surprisingly affecting. The internet today has made it clear that this is the way so many people feel. That people are emotionally affected by this isn&#39;t weird... it&#39;s beautiful. It&#39;s not hysteria, it&#39;s how music works, how it should work. I saw a tweet from some journalist suggesting that we should all grow up, it made me sad that someone could feel so detached and such a lack of empathy. There&#39;s a picture of my granny sitting on a bench in Glasgow with a pink haired young woman holding a copy of Scary Monsters and Super Creeps - wish I could find that photo - it always made me smile. I never saw him live... he was playing stadiums when I was going to pubs and clubs for my music. I don&#39;t have regrets... that&#39;s not what Bowie meant to me. When asked I&#39;d always answer Low - I do love Low, but if I was being honest I&#39;d have to say Hunky Dory. I didn&#39;t finish my post about Lemmy... it was harder to write because of the different relationship I had with him." />

<p>I've barely come to terms with Lemmy's passing... and now this. It's hard to comprehend how ingrained in my growing up Bowie's music was. He was one of those few artists who spanned my listening from as early as I remember - I guess that's why it feels weird. I have memories of talking about him at school the day after a TOTP appearance. I was nine or ten, I remember talking about Bowie and The Sweet and T-Rex at school.</p>
<p>I heard about Bowie's death when I got up this morning. I didn't play any Bowie until this afternoon. I needed time. With Lemmy it was different, I went straight to the records.</p>
