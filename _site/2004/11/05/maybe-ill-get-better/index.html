I signed up for a Flickr account because I&#39;m not only rubbish at blogging but I&#39;m also rubbish at sharing the thousands of photos we take with our friends and family and flickr seemed a good way of fixing that. Still playing around with it at the moment but the fact that I can blog from it might inspire me to keep this a little more up-to-date.
