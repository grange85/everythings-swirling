Improve myself - hopefully the reading will help this - but more than that I want to understand more and put that understanding to some decent use.

  <h1>A New Year</h1>

  <p>I'm an atheist - I was brought up as a catholic but as soon as I was able to think for myself (and was brave enough to tell my mum!) I chucked it all in - it made no sense at all to me. So I became a teenager and outed myself as a non-believer at approximately the same time.I love christmas - sure there is the religious aspect of it but that has been so watered down over the years that it doesn't muck it up - and there is the capitalism that's supposed to be ruining it but, frankly I never really saw it myself - capitalism is something that rubs away at us all year round - it may be a little more intense at this time of year but I've never let myself<br />

I can't remember ever before receiving no CDs as presents (maybe last year) but then I buy CD presents for myself all year round.</p>
<p>And then it's another year - as is quaintly traditional the start of a new year is when you make decisions that should change your life, but generally don't.</p>
