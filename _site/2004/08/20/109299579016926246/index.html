Adam's been away visiting my sister and her family for a  couple of days - you'd have thought that this would be a relief but the house is so empty and quiet without him.</p>
<p>Hazel and I took the advantage of this "freedom" to go and catch a couple of films at the <a href="http://www.riversidestudios.co.uk/">Riverside</a> last night. <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0335266/">Lost in Translation</a> I enjoyed, the slow paced film set in a fast paced city was really nicely done - and having The Jesus and Mary Chain and My Bloody Valentine on the soundtrack is pretty much enough to outweigh the worrying concerns of racial stereotyping that the film gave me.</p>
<p><a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0338013/">The Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind</a> was even better - I hadn't heard anything about the film which made it's unusual-ness so much more enjoyable. Another love story - I'm such a sop.</p>
