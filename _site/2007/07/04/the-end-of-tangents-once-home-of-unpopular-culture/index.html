  <h1>The end of Tangents - once home of Unpopular Culture</h1>

  <p>I sort of missed it happening but at the tail end of last month the very excellent <a href="http://www.tangents.co.uk/frozen.html">Tangents</a> (the home of unpopular culture) <a href="http://unpopular.typepad.com/unpopular/2007/06/dusty-in-here.html">called it a day</a>. I can't remember how long I've been going there pretty much as long as I remember (in an Internet way). Lots and lots of great writing about good music and art and photography has introduced me to a lot of good music and art and photography. All the content still sits there but it's sad to think that there won't be anything new. I'm sure I'll keep going there every couple of weeks - just out of habit.</p>
