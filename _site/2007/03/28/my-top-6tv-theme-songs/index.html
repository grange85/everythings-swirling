<meta name="description" content="I&#39;m not entirely sure this will make it to six but here goes... Jacky - White Horses I remember loving this show although don&#39;t ask me what it was about and maybe I only loved the theme song and one other aspect of the show (young teenage boys think like that). Britta Phillips &amp; Dean Wareham do a lovely version on their new album - and there&#39;s also a French version they&#39;ve recorded as well although I&#39;ve not heard that as yet. Nerf Herder - Buffy the Vampire Slayer Theme I&#39;ve watched a hell of a lot of BtVS over the last couple of years - and I mean lots and lots and lots and I still haven&#39;t got bored of drumming on my legs during the theme tune - which I guess means that it&#39;s a tune I&#39;ll never get bored of. Scooby Doo, Where Are You - David Mook Timeless - it&#39;s always jarring to catch a Scooby Doo that doesn&#39;t have the classic theme song. I also am quite fond of all those bubblegummy chase scene songs they had. Roobarb Theme - Johhny Hawksworth This is just brilliant - it pops into my head at completely random moments and always makes me smile! Quincy Jones - Ironside This, rather than being &quot;timeless&quot;, is just so beautifully of its time! Futurama Theme - dunno but probably Christopher Tyng Another one, like BtVS that I don&#39;t seem to get bored with. OK - I made it and I’ve missed out plenty…&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <h1>My Top 6…TV theme songs</h1>

  <p>I'm not entirely sure this will make it to six but here goes...<br /></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jacky/_/White+Horses" class="bbcode_track">Jacky - White Horses</a><br /><br />
I remember loving this show although don't ask me what it was about and maybe I only loved the theme song and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR6z8GUywyc">one other aspect of the show</a> (young teenage boys think like that). <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Britta%2BPhillips%2B%2526%2BDean%2BWareham" class="bbcode_artist">Britta Phillips &amp; Dean Wareham</a> do a lovely version on their new album - and there's also a French version they've recorded as well although I've not heard that as yet.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nerf+Herder/_/Buffy+the+Vampire+Slayer+Theme" class="bbcode_track">Nerf Herder - Buffy the Vampire Slayer Theme</a><br /><br />
I've watched a hell of a lot of BtVS over the last couple of years - and I mean lots and lots and lots and I still haven't got bored of drumming on my legs during the theme tune - which I guess means that it's a tune I'll never get bored of.</li>
<li>Scooby Doo, Where Are You - David Mook<br /><br />
Timeless - it's always jarring to catch a Scooby Doo that doesn't have the classic theme song. I also am quite fond of all those bubblegummy chase scene songs they had.</li>
<li>Roobarb Theme - <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Johhny+Hawksworth" class="bbcode_artist">Johhny Hawksworth</a><br /><br />
This is just brilliant - it pops into my head at completely random moments and always makes me smile!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Quincy+Jones/_/Ironside" class="bbcode_track">Quincy Jones - Ironside</a><br /><br />
This, rather than being "timeless", is just so beautifully of its time!</li>
<li>Futurama Theme - dunno but probably <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Christopher+Tyng" class="bbcode_artist">Christopher Tyng</a><br /><br />
Another one, like BtVS that I don't seem to get bored with.</li></ul><br /><br />
<br /><br />
OK - I made it and I've missed out plenty...<br /></p>
