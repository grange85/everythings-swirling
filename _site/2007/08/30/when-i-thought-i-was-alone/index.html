  <h1>When I thought I was alone…</h1>

  <p>There was a time in between Galaxie 500 splitting up (in 1991) and us getting the Internet (late 1993 or early 94 I'd guess <a href="#footnote1">[1]</a>) when I thought I was the only Galaxie 500 fan in the world. Occasionally a journalist (normally <a href="http://planbmag.com/blogs/staff/author/everett/">Everett True</a>) might drop their name into an article but otherwise it was just me. The friends I'd seen Galaxie 500 with didn't seem all that bothered by the fact that they weren't around any more. Of course there was Luna, but I never really knew any Luna fans either and was always surprised that there was anyone else at the Luna shows I went to. So the Internet was a glorious revelation not only did the people on there know of Galaxie 500 but some of them loved them as much as I did.</p>
