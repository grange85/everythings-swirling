But &quot;Nancy &amp; Lee&quot; and &quot;Nancy and Lee Again&quot; are both great albums. I never really went beyond those two - not for any other reason than discovering my *own* music was more important than discovering my parents (or my older brother&#39;s) music. &lt;/blockquote&gt; Lee Hazlewood pretty much dropped off my radar until Dean Wareham and Claudia Silver released the Cagney &amp; Lacee album Six Feet of Chain with its two great Hazlewood covers - the title track and By The Way (I Still Love You)." />

A couple of months back on the Galaxie 500 Mailing List we were discussing the great <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Hazlewood">Lee Hazlewood</a>, who passed away yesterday. This is what I had to say back then...</p>
<blockquote><p>The second Nancy & Lee album "Again" was played a lot while I was growing up - "Did You Ever" still always reminds me of my mum (although it's not a favourite of mine, possibly because there was a time when I heard it too much!). But "Nancy & Lee" and "Nancy and Lee Again" are both great albums. I never really went beyond those two - not for any other reason than discovering my *own* music was more important than discovering my parents (or my older brother's) music.<br />

<p>Lee Hazlewood pretty much dropped off my radar until Dean Wareham and Claudia Silver released the Cagney & Lacee album <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/galaxie/index.php?album_id=89">Six Feet of Chain</a> with its two great Hazlewood covers - the title track and By The Way (I Still Love You).</p>
