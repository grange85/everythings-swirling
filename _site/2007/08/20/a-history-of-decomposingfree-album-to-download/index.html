  <h1>A history of Decomposing…free album to download!</h1>

  <p>Sometime in the Autumn of 2004 I put forward the idea of a tribute album to the members of the Galaxie 500 Mailing List and a bunch of excellent contributions trickled in over the next few months...the plan was to put out a proper CD in a nice two colour package sometime in the spring of 2005. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
The project slipped...and slipped...partially because I was trying to get up the nerve to put together a contribution of my own (something that never happened) but mostly because I was just crap at getting things together...I started trying to ignore the reminders I set for myself but by the end of 2005 it was getting embarrassing.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I decided to scale down the ambition and go for a CDR and a laser printed b/w sleeve and so in March 2006 the tribute finally saw the light of day. I can't remember how many copies I sold/gave away (probably 80 or so).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
But it was really too good a project to leave it at that. One of the contributers, <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/mkorchia/" class="bbcode_user">mkorchia</a> of the very excellent <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Watoo+Watoo" class="bbcode_artist">Watoo Watoo</a> suggested a few months back that I should put the album on line somewhere - and even that took me bloody ages!<br /><br />
