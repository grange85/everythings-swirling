I kept buying the albums and giving them a chance up until Up which was the final straw. Anyway I was having a major clear up at work and found a CDR of REM live in Hyde Park in 2005 and gave it a listen and occasionally got the buzz that reminded me why I liked them back then. But mostly I was astounded by just how fucking huge they became, I knew they got big in the time I stopped paying attention - but I was thinking a-couple-of-nights-at-the-Hammy-Odeon big not filling-a-royal-park-in-London big! Hearing the audience chanting along to The One I Love or Losing My Religion was just astounding to the point of sending shivers up my spine. I think I might dig out a CD or two tomorrow...just for old times sake... REM in Hyde Park - 2005 (originally uploaded by thesneakerpimp)" />

  <h1>Just dug this one out #8 - REM</h1>

  <p>OK - it wasn't an album I "just dug out" - I haven't listened to an <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M." class="bbcode_artist">R.E.M.</a> album for so very long, it is a bit frightening to think how much I listened to them from <a title="R.E.M. - Reckoning" href="http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M./Reckoning" class="bbcode_album">Reckoning</a> to <a title="R.E.M. - Document" href="http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M./Document" class="bbcode_album">Document</a> and then suddenly stopped. I kept buying the albums and giving them a chance up until <a title="R.E.M. - Up" href="http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M./Up" class="bbcode_album">Up</a> which was the final straw.<br /><br />
