  <h1>Is vanity the driving force behind last.fm?</h1>

  <p>Ugh! I just noticed that <a title="Village People - Macho Man" href="http://beta.last.fm/music/Village+People/_/Macho+Man" class="bbcode_track">Macho Man</a> by <a href="http://beta.last.fm/music/Village+People" class="bbcode_artist">Village People</a> has been in my recently played tracks list on last.fm for more than 24 hours - I won't bother trying to explain how it got there, although it just might have <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/hazel/2006/04/20/im-thinking-of-getting-fat/">something to do with this</a>. But it highlights one of the dangers of last.fm in that I can't help but be aware of what I'm listening to and how it might colour other peoples perception of me. Of course it's just vanity, nobody really cares that much - but then is vanity the driving force behind last.fm?</p>
