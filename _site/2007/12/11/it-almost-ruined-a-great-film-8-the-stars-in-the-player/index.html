<p>So Burt Reynolds and Angelica Huston are carefully placed to give the film that real Hollywood feel and Rod Steiger lurks and Andie MacDowell and John Cusack look uncomfortable. And, while it might be fun to spot them, it ultimately becomes an annoyance.

<p>The film is still great despite this and a lot of that is because of Tim Robbins and Cynthia Stevenson (because I &hearts; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Like_Me">Joy Lass</a>) and not so much because of Greta Scacchi whose role doesn't really get the depth it ought to have.</p></p>
