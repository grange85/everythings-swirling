Work much harder at my piano practice and music theory. Read more - and not just comics...proper books as well! Go to bed earlier - over 2006 it went from being just after midnight to close to 2am! Write more - NaNoWriMo was an interesting experiment but I need to keep writing because it needs to get MUCH better! Improve myself - I need to find myself a &quot;direction&quot;. Not to buy a record on a major label - maybe childish petulance but I don&#39;t see why I should throw my money at the big four when there is so much really great indie music around. Get better at blogging - 2006 was an improvement but I still could get better!&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;" />
