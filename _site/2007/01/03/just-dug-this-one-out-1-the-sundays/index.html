Listening to it right now it sounds a little dated but those jangly Smiths-y (yawn) guitars and Harriet’s voice just makes me very nostalgic for the late 80s and early 90s when discovering music was so exciting (it still is but in a different way - the Internet has made discovering music a lot less challenging!). Their second album “Blind” was forgettable and until I checked Wikipedia I didn’t even know there was a third! I think just one perfect Sundays album is all I need.&lt;/p&gt; Of course my enduring memory of The Sundays is that they are responsible for me seeing Galaxie 500 one less time than I should have done when they postponed their London show (with G500 supporting) - the rescheduled gig was great but no Galaxie 500! &lt;/param&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;/embed&gt; &lt;/p&gt;" />
