  <h1>I should never underestimate the power of WordPress</h1>

  <p>There is, of course, a <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> plug-in for everything and so it was negligent of me not to consider that I could have my cake AND eat it. Through the power of the lovely <a href="http://projects.radgeek.com/feedwordpress/">FeedWordPress</a> I can have all those music posts I make on my <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/grange85/journal/">Last.fm journal</a> appear, as if by magic, on this blog. OK it does mean the same thing being in two places but it is still a good thing!</p></p>
