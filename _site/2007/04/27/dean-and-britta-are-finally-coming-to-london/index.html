  <h1>Dean and Britta are (finally) coming to London</h1>

  <p>It's been (almost) two and a half years since I last saw <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Luna" class="bbcode_artist">Luna</a> - I miss them - and since about 1989 there haven't been too many gaps that long when I haven't seen <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Dean+Wareham" class="bbcode_artist">Dean Wareham</a> on a London stage either as part of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Galaxie+500" class="bbcode_artist">Galaxie 500</a> or Luna.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
So I am very excited to hear that <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Britta%2BPhillips%2B%2526%2BDean%2BWareham" class="bbcode_artist">Britta Phillips &amp; Dean Wareham</a> will be playing <a href="http://www.last.fm/event/221443" class="bbcode_event">in London in June</a>.</p>
