  <h1>What's to become of Everything's Swirling…</h1>

  <p>I've decided to move all my <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/grange85/journal/">music related blogging into last.fm</a> - which sort of leaves this blog with a rather big hole to fill. It never was meant to be a music blog - but that's pretty much what it turned into.</p>
<p>Last.fm is a fantastic website and while it's blogging (journals) are still a little bit lacking in features (no decent archives, no import and export etc.) I think that as I spend a lot of my time over there it seems to make sense to write my barely read snobbish rants over there.</p>
<p>So...what to do with Everything's Swirling...I do have a life beyond music - a family, television and films I watch, photos I take and photos I like - so there's plenty that I could be doing with it - but over the last couple of months mostly what I've done with it is just ignore it - I'm just about ready to change that but we'll see how things pan out.</p>
<p>In the meantime you can see my <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/grange85/journal/">last.fm journal</a> or <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/grange85/">profile</a> or check out the <a href="http://www.last.fm/group/A+Head+Full+of+Wishes">A Head Full of Wishes group</a> over there.</p>
<p>I'll probably turn the <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/galaxie/">A Head Full of Wishes</a> site into more of a blog than just news so for Galaxie 500, Luna, Damon & Naomi, Dean & Britta bits keep an eye over there...</p>
