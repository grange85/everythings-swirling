<meta name="description" content="Dean &amp; Britta week &lt;/p&gt; Dean &amp; Britta @ Luna Lounge(originally uploaded by tammylo) I was looking for pictures of Britta wearing those knee high boots she seems to wear quite often - most notably in all the promo shots for Back Numbers. But then I came across this sweet picture of Britta wearing some sweet strappy heely sandals (I’m sure this type of shoe has a name but as this series progresses it’s clear that my knowledge of footwear is very limited). They have heels and they have straps - and despite that they look comfortable - and much nicer than knee highs which have never really been my thing! #11 Britta Phillips (of Dean and Britta) in her strappy heeled sandals. &lt;/p&gt;" />

I was looking for pictures of Britta wearing those knee high boots she seems to wear quite often - most notably in all the <a href="http://deanandbritta.com/_imgs2/performancesimg.jpg">promo shots for Back Numbers</a>. But then I came across this sweet picture of Britta wearing some sweet strappy heely sandals (I'm sure this type of shoe has a name but as this series progresses it's clear that my knowledge of footwear is very limited). They have heels and they have straps - and despite that they look comfortable - and much nicer than knee highs which have never really been my thing!<br /><br />
