<meta name="description" content="Banking, Violence and the Inner Life Today - McCarthy My fondness for McCarthy was partly founded in their politics - at a time when Thatcher and her Tory party seemed hell bent on destroying all that I believed in, I was excited to find anyone who railed against them - and McCarthy railed...I vaguely remember them dissing Billy Bragg in an interview for being too right wing. But beyond their politics they made just the sort of guitar pop that I loved then (and still pretty much love now). Their last album really does seem to be the end of the road though - not because it&#39;s bad (it&#39;s very good). But more because it seemed that McCarthy (like Thatcher) was a thing of the 80s (Thathcer was ousted within six months of the release of this album). Let&#39;s look at the evidence... It included a prominent role for Laetitia Sadier whose credits up until this point where for translating McCarthy lyrics into French. Laetitia and Tim Gane of course went on to form Stereolab. It included a shameless (and utterly brilliant) attempt to jump on the baggy bandwagon (Get a Knife Between Your Teeth). It was shinier, more produced than their previous efforts. I saw what was (possibly) their penultimate performance at ULU supporting The Chills, they were plagued by poor sound but I still remember it fondly. I love Stereolab and for a while it seemed that Malcolm Eden’s Herzfeld would also help fill the hole that McCarthy left. If pushed I’d probably say I prefer I Am a Wallet - but I definitely listen to this one more. &lt;/p&gt;" />

  <h1>Just dug this one out #6 - McCarthy</h1>

  <p><a title="McCarthy - Banking, Violence and the Inner Life Today" href="http://www.last.fm/music/McCarthy/Banking%2C+Violence+and+the+Inner+Life+Today" class="bbcode_album">Banking, Violence and the Inner Life Today</a> - <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/McCarthy" class="bbcode_artist">McCarthy</a><br /><br />
<br /><br />
My fondness for McCarthy was partly founded in their politics - at a time when Thatcher and her Tory party seemed hell bent on destroying all that I believed in,  I was excited to find anyone who railed against them - and McCarthy railed...I vaguely remember them dissing <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Bragg" class="bbcode_artist">Billy Bragg</a> in an interview for being too right wing. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
But beyond their politics they made just the sort of guitar pop that I loved then (and still pretty much love now). Their last album really does seem to be the end of the road though - not because it's bad (it's very good). But more because it seemed that McCarthy (like Thatcher) was a thing of the 80s (Thathcer was ousted within six months of the release of this album).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Let's look at the evidence...<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>It included a prominent role for <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Laetitia+Sadier" class="bbcode_artist">Laetitia Sadier</a> whose credits up until this point where for translating McCarthy lyrics into French. Laetitia and <span title="Unknown artist" class="bbcode_unknown">Tim Gane</span> of course went on to form <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Stereolab" class="bbcode_artist">Stereolab</a>.</li>
<li>It included a shameless (and utterly brilliant) attempt to jump on the baggy bandwagon (<a title="McCarthy - Get a Knife Between Your Teeth" href="http://www.last.fm/music/McCarthy/_/Get+a+Knife+Between+Your+Teeth" class="bbcode_track">Get a Knife Between Your Teeth</a>).</li>
<li>It was shinier, more <em>produced</em> than their previous efforts.</li></ul>I saw what was (possibly) their penultimate performance at ULU supporting <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Chills" class="bbcode_artist">The Chills</a>, they were plagued by poor sound but I still remember it fondly. I love Stereolab and for a while it seemed that <span title="Unknown artist" class="bbcode_unknown">Malcolm Eden</span>'s <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Herzfeld" class="bbcode_artist">Herzfeld</a> would also help fill the hole that McCarthy left.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If pushed I'd probably say I prefer <a title="McCarthy - I Am a Wallet" href="http://www.last.fm/music/McCarthy/I+Am+a+Wallet" class="bbcode_album">I Am a Wallet</a> - but I definitely listen to this one more.<br /><br />
