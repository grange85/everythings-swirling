The important thing was to not let the story get in the way of what made the film so great and that was Rigby Reardon dealing with Humphrey Bogart and Veronica Lake and Charles Laughton and Barbara Stanwyck... But by the end the film was straining and struggling to resolve the bloody silly killer-cheese storyline and suddenly you wished that they had tried a little bit harder with the story so that they didn&#39;t need to let the film fizzle out the way it did. &lt;/param&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;/embed&gt; If ever there was a film that was crying out for a special edition DVD this has to be it...so if someone could sort that out I&#39;d be grateful." />

  <h1>It almost ruined a great film - #7: The story in Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid</h1>

  <p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083798/">Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid</a> is superb, Steve Martin at his best, Rachel Ward appears to be not too bad an actor and all those other great stars...Of course the story didn't really matter so it seems a bit churlish to criticise it for being rubbish. The important thing was to not let the story get in the way of what made the film so great and that was Rigby Reardon dealing with Humphrey Bogart and Veronica Lake and Charles Laughton and Barbara Stanwyck...</p>
<p>But by the end the film was straining and struggling to resolve the bloody silly killer-cheese storyline and suddenly you wished that they had tried a little bit harder with the story so that they didn't need to let the film fizzle out the way it did.</p>

<p>If ever there was a film that was crying out for a special edition DVD this has to be it...so if someone could sort that out I'd be grateful.</p>
