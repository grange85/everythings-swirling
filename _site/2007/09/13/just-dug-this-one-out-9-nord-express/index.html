This post on Lunapark6 gave me a kick and inspired me to track down some Nord Express...and that tracking down turned out to be a bit problematic as not only finding the tape was difficult but digging out something to play it on was likely to be a pain.

Many moons ago someone sent me a tape with a lot of <a href="http://www.peapodrecordings.com/nordexpress.php">Nord Express</a> tracks on because anyone who loved Galaxie 500 would surely love Nord Express - it was true, I did love them - but it was a very careless love, and like so much stuff that I had on tape, it sort of fell down the back of the sofa when my tape Walkman was replaced with a CD walkman and then an mp3 player.</p>
<p>Ron Harrity of Nord Express provided a fantastic version of <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/galaxie/index.php?track_id=24">Cold Night</a> to the <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/galaxie_list_tribute/">Galaxie 500 List tribute album</a> (and offered to help out - an offer I shamefully turned down, a decision that contributed to the album's (very) long lead time...)</p>
