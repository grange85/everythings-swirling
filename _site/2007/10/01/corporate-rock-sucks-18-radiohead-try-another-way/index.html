  <h1>Corporate rock sucks #18: Radiohead try another way…</h1>

  <p>I have very vivid memories of standing in Beggars Banquet in Kingston and NOT BUYING the first <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead" class="bbcode_artist">Radiohead</a> EP <a title="Radiohead - Drill" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/Drill" class="bbcode_album">Drill</a> because they were on a major label - and I was very suspicious of major labels even back then (1992) and doubly suspicious of a band with no (recording) history turning up on a major. It's funny (to me anyway) that they are now doing their bit to bring down the vile music industry.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I eventually succumbed and do own an album or three but I admire them all the more now that they have finally ditched the label and have decided to release their new record <span title="Unknown album" class="bbcode_unknown">In Rainbows</span> on their own. They have also taken an "honesty box" route by <a href="http://www.inrainbows.com/Store/Quickindex2.html">offering the download version at whatever price the customer wants to pay</a>.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
It helps that they're huge and can take a chance on this but I sincerely hope that this proves that you can live outside of the system. Whether it's HUGE Radiohead or not so huge <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Kristin+Hersh" class="bbcode_artist">Kristin Hersh</a> who <a href="http://www.throwingmusic.com/blog/2007/08/thoughts-on-sustainability.html">recently announced that she no longer feels she wants to be a part of the system</a>...<br /></p>

A big fat pat on the back to Radiohead...and another nail in the coffin of the music industry.</p>
