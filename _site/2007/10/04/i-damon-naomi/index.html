Kirstiecat has a <a href="http://kirstiecat.com/archives/2484">a short review</a> and a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/kirstiecat/sets/72157602258594059/">lovely set of photos</a> of Damon & Naomi's recent show in Chicago...<br /><br />
I'm looking forward to the end of November when they reach London although I'm a bit sad that they only seem to be doing a <a href="http://www.last.fm/event/352837">support slot in a mid-sized venue</a> rather than a headliner in a tiny club...that would be so much nicer.<br />
