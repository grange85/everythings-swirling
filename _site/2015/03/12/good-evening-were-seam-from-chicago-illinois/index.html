They supported Yo La Tengo at The Borderline. I&#39;d been listening to the brilliant Headsparks all week but didn&#39;t realise they were on the bill until we arrived at the venue. A short but splendid set. The evening still rates as one of my favourites. Seam were a brilliant treat and this was my first Yo La Tengo show, around the time of May I Sing With Me, and was also sensational.
