<meta name="description" content="The Farmer&#39;s Wife is a gently paced and sweetly realised comedy. Hitch takes a play and turns it into a perfectly passable silent film. There is no twist, when the widowed farmer draws up a list of prospective wives near the start of the film and leaves off his long-serving and long-suffering maid (Lillian Hall Davis), it doesn&#39;t take a rocket scientist to see that this is an oversight that will ultimately be rectified. The comedy that happens along the way is predictable but fun. The Farmer&#39;s Wife at The Hitchcock Zone The Farmer&#39;s Wife at BFI Screenonline Watched: 2015-03-28 Source: DVD Rating: 6/10" />

<p>The Farmer's Wife is a gently paced and sweetly realised comedy. Hitch takes a play and turns it into a perfectly passable silent film. There is no twist, when the widowed farmer draws up a list of prospective wives near the start of the film and leaves off his long-serving and long-suffering maid (Lillian Hall Davis), it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that this is an oversight that will ultimately be rectified. The comedy that happens along the way is predictable but fun.<br />
