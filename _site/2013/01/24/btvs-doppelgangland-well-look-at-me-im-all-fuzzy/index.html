  <h1>BtVS: Doppelgangland / Well, look at me. I'm all fuzzy</h1>

  <p>We're not allowed to watch the next episode until I've blogged about this one and Hazel's getting impatient. It ought to be easy because I love Doppelgangland, and who doesn't, but it's easier to write half-arsed blog posts about episodes you don't like... an episode you love deserves more. Sadly this one won't get more. Just assume this is a beautiful and eloquent post about one of my top 5 Buffy episodes!</p>
<p>In reality it'll be a couple of quotes and a screengrab and a music video that is vaguely related (I have no idea what yet so it may be totally unrelated!)<br />
