  <h1>Homecoming Queen</h1>

  <p>In November of 2001 as part of the Giant Sand curated night of the Beyond Nashville season aty London's Barbican Mark Linkous  performed this gorgeous Homecoming Queen with Polly Harvey helping out. I have a recording of the whole show but it's such a mess and I haven't been brave enough to sort through the three hours and track it - I may do one day as there are some treats on it.</p>
<p>Here's an extract from the review I wrote at the time</p><br />
