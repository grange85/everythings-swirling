<meta name="description" content="I&#39;m not entirely sure how Espers II [amazon.com | amazon.co.uk] managed to slip through the net - maybe it&#39;s because Hazel bought it so I never considered it - which is ridiculous because it&#39;s another great album...and I saw them play last night and was reminded how much I had enjoyed (and am enjoying) their album. Just lovely... Nathan Amundson&#39;s one man band Rivulets (technically I think that should probably be a lower-case &#39;r&#39; but it just looks wrong) released another superb album You Are My Home. Minimalist is a word that often crops up in Rivulets reviews but it never seems right to me because it almost seems like it ignores just how beautifully created the songs are implies that they don&#39;t have all the depth that they do...I suspect You Are My Home may well be the best Rivulets album so far. You can buy it direct from Nathan at the Rivulets website &lt;/p&gt;" />
