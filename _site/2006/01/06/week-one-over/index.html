  <h1>Week one over</h1>

  <p>The first post in my pretty new <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> blog.</p></p>
<p>A week at work gazing vacantly at the PC monitor drowning in a wash of 80s indie (JaMC, Sonic Youth, Stone Roses) and 60s Jazz (Miles, Cannonball, Bill Evans, Monk) and wondering what my first new purchase of the year will be. My <a href="http://www.normanrecords.com/reviews.php">Norman records</a> email update came and went without any great inspiration. and a lazy trawl around my favourite blogs was equally unproductive. Maybe its too early in the year to be inspired.</p></p>
