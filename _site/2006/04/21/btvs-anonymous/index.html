<p>So the two of us are stitting down to watch the entire run again - we manufactured an "excuse" involving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_%28TV_series%29">Angel</a> (which we haven't seen as yet) but to be honest we just wanted to watch it again - and it's not like we have anything else to watch (maybe 30 or 40 films and a few TV series - not really that much).</p>
