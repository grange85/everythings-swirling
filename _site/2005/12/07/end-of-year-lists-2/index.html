  <h1>End of year lists #2</h1>

  <p>Next up is Robert at <a href="http://www.donewaiting.com">donewaiting.com</a> who puts <a href="http://www.decemberists.com">The Decemberists</a> "Picaresque" right at the top - which is probably very close to where it'll be when I finally get my list sorted out. Nice to see the very very excellent Damon &amp; Naomi album in the top 10. There's links to mp3s or videos for most of Roberts picks.</p>
