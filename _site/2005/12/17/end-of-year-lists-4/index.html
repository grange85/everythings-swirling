  <h1>End of year lists #4</h1>

  <p>Sorry - I nearly missed this one - a couple of weeks ago <a href="http://blog.largeheartedboy.com/">Largehearted Boy</a> put up <a href="http://largeheartedboy.com/blog/archive/2005/12/2005s_largehear.html">2005's Largehearted Favourite Albums</a> - good read and plenty to download and check out.</p></p>
<p>It's a very cool blog as well that acts as an aggregator for all things cool if, like me, you're not very good at keeping your eyes on what's happening or what's available to download</p></p>
