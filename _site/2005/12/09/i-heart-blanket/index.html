<p>One of my fave discoveries of the year has been the very lovely <a href="http://www.allloveisdead.com/">Blanket</a> (see also Stephen Burch's Blanket blog <a href="http://www.allloveisdead.blogspot.com/">here</a>) - they haven't released much, as far as I can tell, but their site has a bunch of audio files to download and enjoy and if you get in touch they will no doubt send you a CDR full of stuff (well they did for me!).</p>
<p>Stephen Burch also has <a href="http://www.stephenburch.co.uk/">his own site</a> which has a stack of downloadable goodies on it</p>
<p>I guess it's timely also to mention that the only <i>proper</i> release I have by Blanket is the Christmas 7" (released in 2004) by <a href="http://www.bigbillyrecords.co.uk/bigbilly002.html">Big Billy Records</a> and is very well worth picking up if they have any left</p></p>
<p>Update: and with impeccable timing you can now download a complete Blanket show, recorded a couple of weeks back, <a href="http://allloveisdead.blogspot.com/2005/12/sussex-show-at-site.html">from their website</a>.</p>
