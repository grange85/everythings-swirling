  <h1>End of year lists #3</h1>

  <p>This is one I've eagerly awaited - <a href="http://www.chromewaves.net/">Chromewaves</a> is probably my favourite music/culture blog by a long distance and I have a huge respect for Frank's opinion. His <a href="http://www.chromewaves.net/index.php?itemid=2047">end of year list</a> has plenty of interesting choices and listenables for most of them</p></p>
<p>And while I'm on a Chromewaves tip - Capitol Records have signed The Decemberists (see my <a href="http://grange85.blogspot.com/2005/11/major-label-bad.html">earlier post</a> to get an idea of how I feel about this) but Frank managed to cheer me up - as he reported this news on Chromewaves he <a href="http://www.chromewaves.net/index.php?itemid=2053">speculated on what might happen when the band hand in their first record</a> to the major label...</p>
<blockquote><p>I sorta can't wait to see their faces when the Decemberists hand in their next album and the suits are all, "um, what? Gay matadors on an Antarctic expedition?"</blockquote></p></p>
