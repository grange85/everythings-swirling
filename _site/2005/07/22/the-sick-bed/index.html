<meta name="description" content="20041001_214255AA Originally uploaded by grange85. I always love when a band I love do covers - for so many reasons: a new interpretation of an old favourite; a nod to an influence; an introduction to something I&#39;ve never heard... The Decemberists like to do a cover. A while back I came across a recording of them doing a version of The Pogues The Sick Bed Of Cuchulainn - which was pretty cool - mostly because it made me dig out my copy of Rum Sodomy and The Lash which is a damned fine album that I haven&#39;t listened to nearly enough in recent years. Produced by Elvis Costello before relations between he and the band went really sour.
