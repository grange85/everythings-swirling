<p>I've only recently started taking my first steps into the confusing world of jazz - part of the problem has been that <i>jazz</i> is such a broad term and the music I'm discovering now is not the jazz that my dad was playing when I was young.</p>
<p>Despite having lived in Ealing for over 10 years this was my first visit to the free <a href="http://www.ealing.gov.uk/services/ealing+summer+2005/jazz+festival.asp">Ealing  Jazz Festival</a> and it was mostly the appearance by <a href="http://polarbearmusic.com/">Polar Bear</a> that gave me the necessary kick up the behind. <a href="http://grange85.blogspot.com/2004/11/stan-tracey-quintet-bulls-head-27th.html">I'd seen Seb Rochford playing with Stan Tracey</a> last year and having read up on and downloaded Polar Bear I decided that here was jazz music that was a bit closer to the rock I was familiar with.</p>
<p>Polar Bear were preceded on stage by the  <a href="http://www.f-ire.com/people/jonathan_bratoeff.php">Jonathan Bratoeff</a> Quartet - including both Pete Wareham and Seb Rochford. I must admit to being a bit nervous of the prospect of "jazz guitar" - but just as I have had to U-turn on <i>jazz</i> and <i>the saxophone</i> I am obliged to concede that there is a place in this world for jazz guitar.<br />

<p>I'm still no jazz head but I'm prepared to accept that there is some jazz that can almost excite me the way that certain <a href="http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk">indie rock guitar bands</a> do...</p>
