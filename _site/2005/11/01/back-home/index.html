We got back on Saturday after a week in Brittany/Normandy in the North of France - we had smashing weather and a thoroughly relaxing week of paddling, touristing and pique-nique-ing (Baguette et Fromage hmmm).

I found out that I HADN&#39;T been made redundant from the sinking ship that is the BBC Archives Found out that the Galaxie 500 sessions pre-orders were shipping (but mine hadn&#39;t arrived!) Our telephone (and therefore Internet) was STILL broken - it took the lovely BT a mere ELEVEN DAYS to fix it Excited to see that the fabulous &quot;long lost&quot; debut album by Explosions in The Sky, How Strange, Innocence has been re-released so I can update my downloaded copy for the real deal! (via Chromewaves). I noticed that they&#39;re in London next week but almost certainly won&#39;t be able to make it. The very VERY lovely Blanket have revamped their website and included a complete show for download and delectation - and it seems they&#39;re playing at the Tate Britain in London in the new year - looking forward to that!)
