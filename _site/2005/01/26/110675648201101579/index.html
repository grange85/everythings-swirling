<meta name="description" content="Low - The Great Destroyer Low - The Great Destroyer&lt;/p&gt; Ahhh &quot;Slowcore&quot; - the pigeonhole that was made for me. Low&#39;s new album is out now (or soon) and hammers another nail in the coffin of this once great musical (non) &quot;movement&quot;. OK that&#39;s a little bit dramatic but what is with Low seeming to think that being on Sub Pop obliges them to put out a neo-Grunge piece? And how are they getting away with it? &quot;Just Stand Back&quot; is probably the worst song ever put out by a band I once loved - I mean so really REALLY dull it makes me want to cry. I never thought I wouldn&#39;t buy a Low album (hell I still buy Stereolab albums), but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll buy The Great Destroyer because Low don&#39;t make music I love any more. Shame. As a mark of respect today I am listening to Codeine.&lt;/div&gt;" />

Low - The Great Destroyer</p>
<p>Ahhh "Slowcore" - the pigeonhole that was made for me.<br />
<a href="http://www.chairkickers.com">Low</a>'s new album is out now (or soon) and hammers<br />
another nail in the coffin of this once great musical<br />
(non) "movement". OK that's a little bit dramatic but<br />
what is with Low seeming to think that being on Sub<br />
Pop obliges them to put out a neo-Grunge piece? And<br />
how are they getting away with it? "Just Stand Back"<br />
is probably the worst song ever put out by a band I<br />
once loved - I mean so really REALLY dull it makes me<br />
want to cry. I never thought I wouldn't buy a Low<br />
album (hell I still buy Stereolab albums), but I don't<br />
think I'll buy The Great Destroyer because Low don't<br />
make music I love any more. Shame.</p>
