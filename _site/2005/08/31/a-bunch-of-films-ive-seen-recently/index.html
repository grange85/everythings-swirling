Katharine Hepburn was great and Cary Grant was just Cary Grant but the supporting cast were a little overwhelmed. So was I. &lt;/p&gt; The Great Escape and Chicken Run - Watched these two escape classics again and enjoyed them both - I&#39;d forgotten just how downbeat the ending of The Great Escape was so appreciated the success of the chickens breakout. &lt;/p&gt;" />
