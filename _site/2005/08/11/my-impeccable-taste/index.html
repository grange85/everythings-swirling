I believe everything I&#39;m about to write but I don&#39;t want anyone taking it personally... &lt;/p&gt; WRONG! WRONG WRONG WRONG!! Music should be partisan. The fact is that I do have the VERY VERY best taste in music. And anyone who likes Celine Dion or Hall and Oates is plain wrong - anyone who was disappointed in The Clientele has cloth ears and all this &quot;we all love music so it&#39;s fine&quot; attitude is utter nonsense. It gets really granular - I, for instance, don&#39;t get how anyone could think Luna were greater than Galaxie 500 - you&#39;re wrong (Darren - OK that was personal :-) &lt;/p&gt; MAKING MUSIC I can give genuine reasons about how the music I like is ACTUALLY BETTER than, say Coldplay or U2 or Feist (!) - there are things like passion and feel and edge and anger and emotion and love and rejection and embrace and smooth and sharp and cream and sugar and lemon and lime that go into making music - and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn&#39;t - but there IS good music and there IS bad music - it isn&#39;t ALL subjective. &lt;/p&gt; HEARING MUSIC The fact that, for the most part, the music that sells in huge numbers is generally pretty lame means that there is an issue also with the way people hear music. When you ask someone what music they like and they don&#39;t get passionate then they don&#39;t understand music and if they don&#39;t understand music then their opinion is valueless. There are other things that influence taste such as age, environment, sexuality, politics - all of these things make music opinion as a subjective thing questionable - a little girl who likes to scream at boy-bands doesn&#39;t have a relevant or valuable opinion. &lt;/p&gt; THE FACT IS That anyone who is passionate about music (at its purest level) has a right to think that they also have the VERY VERY best taste in music - they have earnt that right through love and passion and understanding. &lt;/p&gt; AND ANOTHER FACT IS That my listening is affected by the same afflictions of emotion and environment as I level at other people and therefore my argument is completely redundant and I should just shut up. &lt;/p&gt; SO WHAT WAS THE BLOODY POINT OF ALL THAT THEN? I guess my point (apart from the fact that I have perfect taste in music) is that only someone who is passionately moved by music is really entitled to respect of their tastes - and there aren&#39;t that many of people who are that passionate. Sure if you are moved by Hall and Oates that&#39;s fine - but most people aren&#39;t - most people just hear music like a backing track or an accompaniment or a funny joke or a nice dance or something to put you to sleep. &lt;/p&gt; MY ARGUMENTS ARE FLAWED But my taste is beyond question :) If you couldn&#39;t argue and be opinionated about music (or politics or sport (preferably NOT ON THIS LIST:)) then life would surely be a less rich thing. &lt;/p&gt; Part two &lt;/p&gt; I don&#39;t get people who are happy to accept other peoples musical opinions because &quot;it&#39;s thier choice&quot; - I genuinely think that without a partisan attitude to music we may as well all be listening to elevator music. I believe that you have to have an attitude because without the ability or desire to justify your tastes there is no point in having taste. &lt;/p&gt; Part three &lt;/p&gt; IMO you can&#39;t accept that all music is equally valid and it&#39;s only people&#39;s perception that changes. It means that all music is equally good which is just plain wrong. &lt;/p&gt; Just because my mum (and a billion mums around the world) loved Daniel O&#39;Donnell records doesn&#39;t mean for a minute that we have to accept that becuase it illicits emotions it is valid musically. It&#39;s shite - and in a lot of ways it was created solely to illicit those very emotions so not only is it shite but its manipulative shite. &lt;/p&gt;" />

  <h1>My impeccable taste…</h1>

  <p>This is a rehash of a couple of posts I made to the Galaxie 500 Mailing List a couple of months back - it seemed a shame for my insane megalomania to vanish into mailing list obscurity</p></p>
<p><b><u>Part one</u></b></p>
<p><b>A PARAGRAPH BECAUSE A SMILEY MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH</b></p>
<p>I'm on a rant so while I believe everything I'm about to write please<br />
be aware that this is my own opinion and is not a personal attack on<br />
anyone. I believe everything I'm about to write but I don't want<br />
anyone taking it personally...</p>
<p></p></p>
<p><b>WRONG! WRONG WRONG WRONG!!</b></p>
<p>Music should be partisan. The fact is that I do have the VERY VERY<br />
best taste in music. And anyone who likes Celine Dion or Hall and<br />
Oates is plain wrong - anyone who was disappointed in The Clientele<br />
has cloth ears and all this "we all love music so it's fine" attitude<br />
is utter nonsense. It gets really granular - I, for instance, don't<br />
get how anyone could think Luna were greater than Galaxie 500 - you're<br />
wrong (Darren - OK that was personal :-)</p></p>
<p><b>MAKING MUSIC</b></p>
<p>I can give genuine reasons about how the music I like is ACTUALLY<br />
BETTER than, say Coldplay or U2 or Feist (!) - there are things like<br />
passion and feel and edge and anger and emotion and love and rejection<br />
and embrace and smooth and sharp and cream and sugar and lemon and<br />
lime that go into making music - and sometimes it works and sometimes<br />
it doesn't - but there IS good music and there IS bad music - it isn't<br />
ALL subjective.</p></p>
<p><b>HEARING MUSIC</b></p>
<p>The fact that, for the most part, the music that sells in huge numbers<br />
is generally pretty lame means that there is an issue also with the<br />
way people hear music. When you ask someone what music they like and<br />
they don't get passionate then they don't understand music and if they<br />
don't understand music then their opinion is valueless. There are<br />
other things that influence taste such as age, environment, sexuality,<br />
politics - all of these things make music opinion as a subjective<br />
thing questionable - a little girl who likes to scream at boy-bands<br />
doesn't have a relevant or valuable opinion.</p></p>
<p><b>THE FACT IS</b></p>
<p>That anyone who is passionate about music (at its purest level) has a<br />
right to think that they also have the VERY VERY best taste in music -<br />
they have earnt that right through love and passion and understanding.</p></p>
<p><b>AND ANOTHER FACT IS</b></p>
<p>That my listening is affected by the same afflictions of emotion and<br />
environment as I level at other people and therefore my argument is<br />
completely redundant and I should just shut up.</p></p>
<p><b>SO WHAT WAS THE BLOODY POINT OF ALL THAT THEN?</b></p>
<p>I guess my point (apart from the fact that I have perfect taste in<br />
music) is that only someone who is passionately moved by music is<br />
really entitled to respect of their tastes - and there aren't that<br />
many of people who are that passionate. Sure if you are moved by Hall<br />
and Oates that's fine - but most people aren't - most people just hear<br />
music like a backing track or an accompaniment or a funny joke or a<br />
nice dance or something to put you to sleep.</p></p>
<p><b>MY ARGUMENTS ARE FLAWED</b></p>
<p>But my taste is beyond question :)</p>
<p>If you couldn't argue and be opinionated about music (or politics or<br />
sport (preferably NOT ON THIS LIST:)) then life would surely be a less<br />
rich thing.</p></p>
<p><b><u>Part two</u></b></p></p>
<p>I don't get people who are happy to accept other peoples musical<br />
opinions because "it's thier choice" - I genuinely think that without<br />
a partisan attitude to music we may as well all be listening to<br />
elevator music. <i>I believe that you have to have an attitude because<br />
without the ability or desire to justify your tastes there is no point<br />
in having taste</i>.</p></p>
<p><b><u>Part three</u></b></p></p>
<p>IMO you can't accept that<br />
all music is equally valid and it's only people's perception that<br />
changes. It means that all music is equally good which is just plain<br />
wrong.</p></p>
<p>Just because my mum (and a billion mums around the world) loved Daniel<br />
O'Donnell records doesn't mean for a minute that we have to accept<br />
that becuase it illicits emotions it is valid musically. It's shite -<br />
and in a lot of ways it was created solely to illicit those very<br />
emotions so not only is it shite but its manipulative shite.</p></p>
