<meta name="description" content="The Skin Game (Alfred Hitchcock - 1931) The Skin Game is based on a stage play, and, like Juno &amp; The Paycock it shows - however, unlike that film this was a tolerable yarn, although so very wordy that it was crying out for Hitch to let the pictures tell a bit of the story - but, no the whole bally thing was practically read out for us. Luckily a lot of it was read by Edmund Gwenn which helped a lot - it&#39;s a a tale of tradition vs progress, inherited wealth vs earned wealth, and how you can never escape your past. Maybe this is Hitch just doing a job, there are few glimpses of what we want, and it doesn&#39;t have the charm and humour of Murder! - and to be honest I maybe love Hitch&#39;s skill at humour more than his skill at suspense. There&#39;s very little humour in The Skin Game. Also, I still don&#39;t know what a Skin Game is? Watched: 2017-02-01 Source: DVD Rating: 4/10" />

<p>The Skin Game is based on a stage play, and, like <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2016/07/28/hitch-11-juno-and-the-paycock-1929/">Juno & The Paycock</a> it shows - however, unlike that film this was a tolerable yarn, although so very wordy that it was crying out for Hitch to let the pictures tell a bit of the story - but, no the whole bally thing was practically read out for us.</p>
<p>Luckily a lot of it was read by Edmund Gwenn which helped a lot - it's a a tale of tradition vs progress, inherited wealth vs earned wealth, and how you can never escape your past.</p>
<p>Maybe this is Hitch just doing a job, there are few glimpses of what we want, and it doesn't have the charm and humour of <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2016/08/19/hitch-12-murder-1930/">Murder!</a> - and to be honest I maybe love Hitch's skill at humour more than his skill at suspense. There's very little humour in The Skin Game.</p>
<p>Also, I still don't know what a Skin Game is?</p>
