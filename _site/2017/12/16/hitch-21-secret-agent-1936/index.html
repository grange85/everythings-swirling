<meta name="description" content="Secret Agent (1936) Argh! I was supposed to write these little updates directly after seeing the film&hellip; but it&#39;s been months since we sat down to watch Secret Agent and we can&#39;t move on until the posts have been written - and Hitch&#39;s true golden period is on the horizon! I enjoyed Secret Agent, it deosn&#39;t have as much charm or wit as The 39 Steps, but it has a silly enjoyable yarn. Gielgud is fine, and while he doesn&#39;t have the fizz with Madeleine Carroll that Donat had, it still works well enough for me (I think Hazel disagrees). And another fab train crash to finish the film - maybe better delivered than that in Number 17, but nowhere near as much fun! Watched: 2017-10 (that&#39;s a guess) Source: DVD Rating: 6/10" />
