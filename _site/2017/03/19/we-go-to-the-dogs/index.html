<meta name="description" content="Next weekend Greyhound racing will end in London, probably (hopefully) for ever. Last weekend, and contrary to so much of what I see as right, Hazel, Adam and I went to the dogs. Memorial to a former football ground I don&#39;t like or approve of dog racing (or for that matter gambling) but did see this as the end of a part of London&#39;s past, and for that reason I thought we should go for one last time (I had been a few times in my less enlightened past), to see the end of an institution. Adam asked if I&#39;d have rushed off so eagerly to the last public execution! Maybe. The last dog racing in London will happen at The Wimbledon Stadium ~ across The Wandle from the former home of Wimbledon FC, and a place I spent a great chunk of my growing up - between 1980 and 1991. Once the dogs have gone, AFC Wimbledon (different name, same club as far as I&#39;m concerned) will be (fingers crossed) coming home to a new stadium built on the site. Wimbledon Stadium is a sprawling, ugly mess of a place, it has no charm, and no beauty - no gorgeous neon welcome. We arrived and I dragged my family around the housing estate where the football ground once was, and then we headed into the dog stadium. There was a queue - maybe because of curious people like us. We stayed for three or four races, it&#39;s an ugly &quot;sport&quot; and it makes people (even us by association with it) become ugly. We photographed the end of this era and left, not sad to see it go, and feeling a little dirty at having done it." />
