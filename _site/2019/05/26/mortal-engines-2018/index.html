<p>Oh I loved Philip Reeves Mortal Engines books - I read the original four many years ago and am only just working through the Fever Crumb trilogy. I loved the originals so much that they were the book I <a href="/swirling/2011/2011-05-24-my-desert-island-discs">took to my desert island</a> when I picked my desert island discs back in 2011.</p>

<p>When the film was announced way back I felt a little apprehensive - I knew it wouldn’t be as good as the book, of course not, it couldn’t be. But my apprehension went a little further…</p>

<ul>
  <li>I find CGI annoyingly inauthentic. I’ve written about <a href="/swirling/2017/2017-03-09-hitch-17-number-seventeen-1932/">why I like models over CGI before</a>:
    <blockquote>
      <p>that’s the joy of models over CGI, becuase neither look authentic … but models <em>are</em> real and therefore give authenticity, and with authenticity comes tension.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>I find Peter Jackson’s films to be overblown and unsubtle.</li>
  <li>I don’t like modern super-hero films.</li>
  <li>Look what happened to His Dark Materials, another series of books I loved but whose first (and so far only) film was a disappointment.</li>
</ul>

<p>But I went in with as much optimism as I could muster. But by the end I felt deflated and annoyed - there was very little to love and all the worst fears of unconvincing CGI, over-reliance on (super-hero-like) action and ridiculously unsubtle plot and script were realised. The heart had been torn out of the book.</p>
