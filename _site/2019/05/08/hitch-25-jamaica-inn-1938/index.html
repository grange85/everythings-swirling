<h3 id="i-was-worried-that-hitchcocks-last-early-british-film-might-see-him-going-it-out-with-a-whimper">I was worried that Hitchcock’s last early British film might see him going it out with a whimper</h3>

<p>Coming after two absolute gems in <a href="/swirling/2018/03/04/hitch-23-young-and-innocent-1937/">Young and Innocent</a> and <a href="/swirling/2018/08/14/hitch-24-the-lady-vanishes-1938/">The Lady Vanishes</a> it’s no wonder that it’s practically a forgotten Hitch - but it’s no whimper.</p>

<p>It has a fabulous cast:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maureen O’Hara is beautiful and has some fire</li>
  <li>Charles Laughton can be relied upon to achieve what no other actor has - being effortlessly brilliant in ridiculously over-the-top, hammy roles (there’s a fine line between a Laughton and a Blessed!)</li>
  <li>Leslie Banks is wonderfully villainous and surprisingly effective in his grubbiness</li>
  <li>and even Robert Newton has some charm although he’s no Donat or <a href="/swirling
/2017/08/05/hitch-20-the-39-steps/">Redgrave</a> (and to be fair the role isn’t written with the charm of a Richard Hannay or Gilbert).</li>
</ul>

<p>The story is a great one, although it feels a bit rushed in places that makes some of the character’s actions seem a bit odd, and the sets and models are nicely convincing - the wreck model sequences are tense and exciting and the murderous wreckers are brilliantly evil.</p>

<p>If anything’s lacking it’s probably Hitch - this is a standard above-average British film of the 30’s - it doesn’t have any flashes that set it any higher.</p>

<p>It’s a great film - but only an average Hitch.</p>
