<p>And so to America, and the big studio resources are clear for all to see on the screen. But Rebecca opens with a lovely model tracking shot through the gates and along the overgrown paths to Manderley - as if Hitch was saying “if you want me Selznick, you get all of me”.</p>

<p>To be honest (and this might be clear if you’ve read <a href="/swirling/category/hitchcock/">any of the previous posts in this series</a>) that Hitch’s model shots are part of what I’ve loved most about his British era films so it’s nice to see he decided not to build a full-size Manderley on the studio backlot.</p>

<p>Hitchcock described Rebecca as being “not a Hitchcock film” but it undoubtedly has Hitchcock’s hand and maybe in the wake of the British films and with the hindsight of his American films Rebecca looks like a Hitch film to me.</p>

<p>Joan Fontaine is adorable as the new Mrs de Winter. She plays demure and insecure so beautifully. While I’ve loved the sassy confidence and give-as-good-as-they-get humour of Pamela (<a href="/swirling

/2018/08/14/hitch-24-the-lady-vanishes-1938/">The Lady Vanishes</a>). I think the gaucheness of Joan’s Mrs de Winter is played in a way that still allows her to show a different kind of strength.</p>

<p>Olivier is Olivier and as such is believable as the damaged Maxim and the scene where they’re watching their honeymoon films is a little heartbreaking to see them so happy in the films and so broken in reality.</p>

<p>Judith Anderson is remarkable as Mrs Danvers, and George Sanders is such a sleaze that you wonder how anyone could want to <em>liaise</em> with him!</p>

<p>But one thing that Hitch might have been right about, and something that maybe does make it a little less Hitchcockian is the lack of humour - it could use a little more light, and while Nigel Bruce and Florence Bates take a pop at lightening things it’s not enough.</p>
