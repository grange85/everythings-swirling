  <h1>Stereolab half-love</h1>

  <p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/48052192801/in/dateposted/" title="Stereolab - Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48052192801_240c8c0bd5_c.jpg" alt="Stereolab - Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire" /></a></p>

<p>I adore Stereolab… up to a point. And that point is probably the day before they released Dots and Loops. It’s my fault we drifted apart, they developed their lounge and I just wanted more motorik.</p>

<p>I saw the band loads of times up until 1997, and just once after in 2004 - <a href="/swirling/2004/08/25/the-only-band-that-can-still-make-me-dance/">the post I wrote back then</a> could probably be applied to last night’s show (except without the trombone) - but I’ll write a new one anyway.</p>

<p class="well">The problem last night was this was Stereolab coming back - and in my head they were coming back from 1997 but in reality they were coming back from 2009.</p>

<p>I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8q1Gdh1ptQ">this video from last week’s Primavera</a> show deceived me slightly with it’s complete pre-1996-ness.</p>

<p>Last night had flashes of ‘lab brilliance and they were Crest (1993), Metronomic Underground (1996), French Disko (1993) and a blinding set-closer Lo Boob Oscillator (1993). But most of the rest of the set was from the albums I was cooler on and had therefore listened to less.</p>

<p>Here’s Crest from last night <em>(apologies for the shakiness of sound and vision)</em>:</p>

<p>…and the end of Lo Boob Oscillator <em>(apologies for shooting this in portrait mode - I hadn’t intended videoing it at all but … hypnotized and before I realised it was too late to change!)</em>:</p>

<p>I think I’d go see a <em>Stereolab 1993</em> tribute band in a shot!</p>

<p>I still love them but I only truly half-loved the show.</p>
