<p>So… at, I’d guess about 22:30 on 27th June 1990 this happened which pretty much changed the course of my life … as follows:</p>

<p>1990: I was working in the film stores at the BBC - not a great job but the pay wasn’t too bad (with some overtime) and enabled me to get out and see gigs</p>

<p>22:30 1990-06-27 - Galaxie 500 returned to the stage for an encore after a brilliant main set - they were joined by Kramer and played Ceremony, followed by Don’t Let Our Youth Go To Waste. I was mesmerised.</p>

<p>1994: I’d been messing around with the internet from pretty early on and towards the end of 1994 I acquired some free web space. But what to do? So I built a Galaxie 500 page. Because I still remembered that feeling from four years before.</p>

<p>1999: I’d managed to get a job working on a European digitisation project, I shared an office with BBC I&amp;A’s first <em>media mmanagers</em> who were asked to help work on developing an intranet site - Research Central - I found myself roped in as the only person who had any experience developing for the web (<em>becuase of Galaxie 500</em>). I ended up doing quite a lot of the work on it.</p>

<p>Research Central changed over the years, it became research.gateway, and then Research Gateway - the job changed, the site changed - as people learned the web they needed less help and more tools - we gave them that.</p>

<p>200?: Actually I’m not sure of when they decided that my skills (<em>because of Galaxie 500</em>) would be put to better use not as part of the archives but as part of the wider BBC intranet. Unfortunately over the following few years a variety of managers came and went and none of them had a clue what to do with us</p>

<p>2013: After too many years of doing nothing and not getting anywhere I decicded to look for another job. I applied for, and got, the job of webmaster at The National Archives <em>because of, you know… Galaxie 500</em>.</p>
