I first saw Maiden in February 1981 on the Killers tour at The Guildford Civic Hall - I don’t remember a great deal but remember being thrilled - and remember chatting to another fan on about the show on the platform of London Road station on the way home. I only saw them two or three times after this - to be honest I think they lost a bit of what made them special when Paul DiAnno was sacked - although it was pretty much the right decision for the band. I never really got on with Dickinson’s voice… also by 1983 NWOBHM was pretty much done for me. Iron Maiden - Sanctuary (1980 )" />

<p>To be honest there are a stack of tracks that <em>trigger</em> NWOBH in my head - but Sanctuary is a pretty fine example.</p>

<p>I first saw Maiden in February 1981 on the Killers tour at The Guildford Civic Hall - I don’t remember a great deal but remember being thrilled - and remember chatting to another fan on about the show on the platform of London Road station on the way home.</p>

<p>I only saw them two or three times after this - to be honest I think they lost a bit of what made them special when Paul DiAnno was sacked - although it was pretty much the right decision for the band. I never really got on with Dickinson’s voice… also by 1983 NWOBHM was pretty much done for me.</p>
