<meta name="description" content="I woke up in the early hours of this morning with Pro&gt;Gen by The Shamen in my head - I have no idea how or why it was there but, there it was. I was never really into dance music - but if someone asked me to pick a 90s dance music archetype this would be it. I first heard the track in 1990 when it turned up on the One Little Indian Greatest Hits Volume 2 spotify link compilation album - which I think was one of those low price samplers that labels would put out - the first side of disc 1 had The Sugarcubes, The Popinjays and The Kitchens of Distinction on it so I imagine that a cheap double LP with those three on it was worth a few quid. The rest of the double LP set was of varying quality but Pro&gt;Gen was pretty good … even if it couldn’t make me dance. Pro&gt;Gen - The Shamen (1990) A year later it was remixed and re-released and became a huge hit - which was also an odd experience for me - being ahead of the game!" />

  <h1>Archetypes #1 - 90s dance music - Pro>Gen by The Shamen</h1>

  <p>I woke up in the early hours of this morning with Pro&gt;Gen by The Shamen in my head - I have no idea how or why it was there but, there it was.</p>

<p>I was never really into dance music - but if someone asked me to pick a 90s dance music archetype this would be it.</p>

<p>I first heard the track in 1990 when it turned up on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/61NvmrfRYajdt2d4THjdsu?si=IM6xKZDpR8SNZxw3z1YjhQ">One Little Indian Greatest Hits Volume 2 <sup>spotify link</sup></a> compilation album - which I think was one of those low price samplers that labels would put out - the first side of disc 1 had The Sugarcubes, The Popinjays  and The Kitchens of Distinction on it so I imagine that a cheap double LP with those three on it was worth a few quid.</p>

<p>The rest of the double LP set was of varying quality but Pro&gt;Gen was pretty good … even if it couldn’t make me dance.</p>

<p>A year later it was remixed and re-released and became a huge hit - which was also an odd experience for me - being ahead of the game!</p>
