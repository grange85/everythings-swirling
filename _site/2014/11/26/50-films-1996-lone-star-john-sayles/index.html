I loved the John Sayles films Matewan, and City of Hope, neither of which I've seen for probably 20 years (or more). In the early 90s (probably 92 or 93) I went with Hazel and some friends to a cinema in Richmond to see Sayles' Passion Fish - quite early in the film I started feeling uncomfortable with the subject matter - or rather with what my head was trying to predict the film was going to be about. This happens occasionally - I'm a wuss and live in perpetual fear of my wussiness. I left. Hazel left with me. </p>
<p>I haven't seen a Sayles film since, and haven't ever seen the end of Passion Fish. I don't think it was necessarily a decision to not see any of his films... more that it just happened that way.</p>
