The intention was that the film I was going to watch from 1987 was John Sayles's Matewan, but I missed out on the DVD on eBay and then Hazel spotted Red Sorghum on Lovefilm, so on Sunday we watched that. It was probably a beautiful looking film, but not the version we saw, which looked really ropey and was poorly cropped. It was also a rather unpleasant story, that developed without sufficient care. I wanted to (and believe I was supposed to) be rooting for Gong Li's character but I never got the chance to understand her.</p>
