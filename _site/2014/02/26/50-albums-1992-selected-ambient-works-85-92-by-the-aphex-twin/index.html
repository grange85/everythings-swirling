Allmusic called this album "<a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/selected-ambient-works-85-92-mw0000213259">a watershed of ambient music</a>" saying that it "reveals no influences and sounds unlike anything that preceded it" - to be honest I think that may be stretching things a wee bit. I bought the first two Aphex Twin "Analogue Bubblebath" EPs in the early 90s, mostly I guess because the inkies were all over them. While I could appreciated the innovation, they were of varying quality and occasionally uninspiring. The same can be levelled at "Selected Ambient Works."</p>
