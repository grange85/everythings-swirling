When it was released I was quite taken with The Trinity Session but listening now it is often just a great big old yawn, maybe I've heard too much beuatiful music played and/or recorded in churches to realise that it's more than just the church-y ambience that makes it great. Maybe I've just got harsher, or harder to please.</p>
<p>I sort of hoped that the album would hint at why I loved it as much as I did, but I just can't figure it out. Maybe it was just the VU cover after all...<br />
