<p>I'm not sure why I thought I didn't like The Pet Shop Boys but they're another of those bands that over the years I've avoided. There are tracks I know I've liked - I've always expressed a liking for Rent - but I can't think of anything I don't like, and surely you can't decide to not like something without actually not liking something.</p>
