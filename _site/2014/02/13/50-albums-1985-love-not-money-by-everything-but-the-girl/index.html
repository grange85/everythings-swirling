My natural aversion to success (aka &#39;snobbery&#39;), that I&#39;ve touched on a couple of times before in this series, and a concern that well financed music of the 80s will surely be ruined by being buried in the shimmery, synthy gloss of over-production, has meant that I have been tiptoeing slowly but steadily through EBGT&#39;s career. I think I may like Love Not Money even more than Eden, it has a couple of tracks that made me wince (Sean being the most notable), but most of the album is rather lovely and Tracey&#39;s voice is just astoundingly rich and warm, that I&#39;m fairly certain she could pull of that supposedly most difficult vocal challenge, the phone book, without any problem at all. Nice little bonus of a cover of The Pretenders Kid to top it all off too... ... but the original is much, much better of course 50 films and 50 albums" />
