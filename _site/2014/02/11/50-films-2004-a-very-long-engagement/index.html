I love Jeunet's films, they look tremendous, they have humour and sweetness and darkness and reward re-watching... and mostly they have Dominique Pinon which is a reason to love a film. A Very Long Engagement has all of that and Audrey Tautou, Jodie Foster and Marion Cotillard - so it doesn't really need me to say why it's great. And it is.</p>
<p>It was a bit hard picking a clip from A Very Long Engagement that didn't either spoil it, or lose something when taken out of context. So here's the trailer for Delicatessen - which is just perfect and spoils nothing ...<br />
