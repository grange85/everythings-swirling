I only caught the last 40 minutes of this , and I already have two films battling to be my 1971 film - but I am rather fond of this sweet film - it's a little weak in spots and has laughably old people playing fifth formers - but Alderton is lovely and the supporting (adult) cast are British 70s TV comedy stalwarts - Deryck Guyler, Joan Sanderson, Richard Davies, Patsy Rowlands. And the "kids" are rather charming too.</p>
