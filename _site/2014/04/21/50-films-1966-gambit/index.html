I adore Shirley MacLaine, that adoration is mostly founded on just two films, Billy Wilder's The Apartment and Bob Fosse's Sweet Charity. Although I'm sure I could pretty much watch her in anything, although maybe I'd draw the line at her new age spouting.</p>
<p>Gambit is missing a few things, a decent story for one, and what story there is is told so poorly that when Michael Caine's Harry makes his big gesture of love at the end, you don't really understand it. But... I'm rather fond of a heist movie and it looks lovely, particularly when Shirley is on the screen, so I didn't mind sitting through it at all.</p>
