<meta name="description" content="Just home from seeing the silent film Why Change Your Wife? at the BFI. The film seemed to be a projected DVD and frankly looked awful, which was a shame. It is a 1920 romantic comedy and despite what might be considered a rather dubious message, is fun and silly, and almost looks like it might get a bit dark in places... but no, goes back to being silly. The three leads, Gloria Swanson, Bebe Daniels (&quot;legally a widow but optically a pippin&quot;) and Thomas Meighan were all rather great. The film was presented with a new score by jazz vocalist Niki King, which was OK, but I found the vocals a bit distracting, it worked in places but often seemed to sit a bit uncomfortably with the film.

Just home from seeing the silent film <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Change_Your_Wife%3F">Why Change Your Wife?</a> at the BFI. The film seemed to be a projected DVD and frankly looked awful, which was a shame. It is a 1920 romantic comedy and despite what might be considered a rather dubious message, is fun and silly, and almost looks like it might get a bit dark in places... but no, goes back to being silly. The three leads, Gloria Swanson, Bebe Daniels ("legally a widow but optically a pippin") and Thomas Meighan were all rather great.<br />

The film was presented with a new score by jazz vocalist <a href="http://www.nikiking.com/news/niki-king-writes-original-silent-film-song-score-with-live-performance-debut-the-birds-eye-view-festival.html">Niki King</a>, which was OK, but I found the vocals a bit distracting, it worked in places but often seemed to sit a bit uncomfortably with the film. Also... can't help watching a band when it has a harp... and I should be watching the film!</p>
