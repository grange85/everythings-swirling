For fear of filling up this series with white, first-world boys with guitars I asked around for suggestions for anything that might take me beyond the obvious. John (from the fab <a href="http://www.speedtheplough.com/">Speed The Plough</a>) suggested I try <a href="http://mayberian.bandcamp.com/album/pseudodeath">Pseudodeath by Hungarian indiepopsters Mayberian Sansk&uuml;lottes</a>, the album is over on Bandcamp for the very reasonable price of nothing at all, so I filed it away until I reached "2012"...</p>
<p>Most of what is on the internet about the band is in Hungarian, but with the help of (the frankly awesome) Google Translate, I've discovered they started off as a duo in 2010, added a drummer for this album, and are now a four piece.</p>
<p>The album is a rather splendid, dreamy, lo-fi gem. Sweet sounds and gentle voices. I kind of wish I'd just ploughed straight in back when John suggested it, I suggest you do.</p>
