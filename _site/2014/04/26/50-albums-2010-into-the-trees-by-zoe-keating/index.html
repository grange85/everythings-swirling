<meta name="description" content="I first encountered Zo&euml; Keating some time in 2008 when I happened across the Radiolab War of the Worlds broadcast that she did the music for, eMusic and iTunes both had releases by her that I then downloaded. She makes remarkable and wonderfully atmospheric music, she does it live, using a cello, some looping software, a laptop and some pedals - but she doesn&#39;t have that predictable (dull) formula that most similar artists have (and there was quite the surge in loop-pedal driven solo artists back then). At some point in the year or so after the Radiolab thing she became a Twitter sensation, if memory serves the fire was lit when someone used her music without permission, and some well-followed folk tweeted about it. She became the first person I followed on Twitter who got a million followers - I&#39;m not sure whether those follows turned into sales, I hope so, but I think it&#39;s significant that she still has more than a million followers. I think that&#39;s probably down to the fact that she&#39;s very good at Twitter. Into The Trees was released in 2010 and is such a beautifully full piece of work, and the sort of music that rewards repeated listening, that it doesn&#39;t matter much that four years on, the follow up (solo) still album hasn&#39;t arrived. Zo&euml; Keating - &quot;(To-day&#39;s version of) The Path&quot; Last year Zo&euml; made it over to the UK and Hazel and I saw her at an overcrowded Vortex. Most of her music is now on Bandcamp, including the wonderful Into The Trees... for just $5 - that&#39;s quite the bargain!
