<meta name="description" content="This is hilarious... it hits every beautiful heavy metal nail so clearly and cleanly on the head it is clearly a joke, and a pretty damned good one at that. I smiled all the way through it because it made me think I was listening to a serious 1981 album rather than a joke 2003 one. And what makes the joke all the better is that this album is better than most of the albums I bought between 1979 and 1982. I&#39;m genuinely surprised I liked this album quite as much as I did, I guess it just caught me right... but from the opening riff of Black Shuck I was pulled in." />
