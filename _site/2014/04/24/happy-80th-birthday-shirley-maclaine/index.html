To-day, the lovely Shirley MacLaine is 80, <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2014/04/21/50-films-1966-gambit/" title="50 films: 1966 - Gambit">last week I watched Gambit</a>... today I'm watching clips from Sweet Charity on YouTube. A few years ago Hazel and I bought tickets to see the film on the big screen and forgot to put it in the calendar, it was about a week after it had screened that we wondered... "when are we going to see Sweet Charity" - so if someone could put it on a big screen in London sometime soon I'd very much appreciate it.</p>
