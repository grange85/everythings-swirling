<meta name="description" content="No Shouts, No Calls was the last (so far) Electrelane album, it was their fourth album and I&#39;d been listening to and loving them since &quot;The Power Out&quot;, their second.

Not long after this album was released the band went &quot;on hiatus&quot; and it looked like I&#39;d never get the chance. I&#39;ve not really stopped listening to this album, or any of the previous two, so this wasn&#39;t revisiting a lost album, but just confirmation at just how much I love it. In August 2011 the band reunited for a few shows and I finally got to see them live, at an overcrowded Scala. It was good, but I think it would have been better if I&#39;d seen them four or five years earlier." />

No Shouts, No Calls was the last (so far) Electrelane album, it was their fourth album and I'd been listening to and loving them since "The Power Out", their second. Somehow I never saw them live despite probably having a billion opportunities. Not long after this album was released the band went "on hiatus" and it looked like I'd never get the chance.</p>
<p>I've not really stopped listening to this album, or any of the previous two, so this wasn't revisiting a lost album, but just confirmation at just how much I love it.</p>
<p>In August 2011 the band reunited for a few shows and I finally got to see them live, at an overcrowded Scala. It was good, but I think it would have been better if I'd seen them four or five years earlier.</p>
