  <h1>If I can't whine here...</h1>

  <p>Today <a href="http://www.nme.com/news/dean-wareham/77294">NME had a news item on the imminent release of a Dean Wareham live album</a>, they decided that the most important thing about this forthcoming release was not that <a href="http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2014/05/14/sonic-cathedral-to-release-dean-wareham-live-in-london-cassette/">Dean Wareham was releasing a live album recorded at two utterly spellbinding shows at St Pancras Old Church in December</a>. </p>
<p>No, what NME considered most important was that Dean was "[covering] New Order on [the] cassette-only album". Now that would be fine, a reputable news source needs an angle to sell their news... except it's not a cover of a New Order track. <a href="http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2013/04/03/originals-ceremony-by-joy-division-covered-by-galaxie-500/">Ceremony was played a number of times by Joy Division before Ian Curtis died</a>... there are at least three recordings to prove it. So... it was a cover of Joy Division.</p>
<p>As well as an angle, a reputable news source really needs to be right.</p>
<p>I snarkily tweeted as much and was baffled by people pointing out that New Order had released it as their first single (which I knew) as if this justified the NME's mistake. It doesn't.</p>
<p>I remember having a similar argument when the first edition of Black Postcards came out and Dean had got the tracklist of Luna's last show wrong... they seemed to think it didn't matter.</p>
<p>It does. Accuracy is important. </p>
