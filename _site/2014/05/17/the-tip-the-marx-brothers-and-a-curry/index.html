Second was Monkey Business which I reckon is probably the best of their Paramount pictures (except when I think Horse Feathers is... or Duck Soup). It loses its legs after they get off the boat - and it does have far too much of Harpo creepily chasing women (any is too much it&#39;s the most unpleasant recurring theme in Marx Brothers films - Monkey Business probably has more than any other film). But it has Groucho sparring with Thelma Todd, and some of my favourite gags &quot;We had to drown the gats, but we saved you a little black gitten.&quot; Groucho and Thelma Todd" />

  <h1>The tip, The Marx Brothers and a curry</h1>

  <p>That's how I spent my 50th birthday. Taking a broken toilet to the refuse tip, watching a couple of Marx Brothers films, and overeating a take-away curry. All done with my dad and my son.</p>
<p>First Marx Bros film we watched was At The Circus, I never thought it was one of their greatest... and it really wasn't. It has a few prime moments (and it has Eve Arden) but on the whole it's too flabby.</p>
