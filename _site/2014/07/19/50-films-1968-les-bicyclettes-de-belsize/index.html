I haven't seen this for ages, probably 30 years, or more. Les Bicyclettes de Belsize is a short musical film, with a slight, but charming, plot, some lovely north London photography (sadly a part of London I'm not too familiar with so didn't get the "been there" buzz I got with, for instance, <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2014/01/07/50-films-1964-a-hard-days-night/" title="50 films: 1964 - A Hard Day&rsquo;s Night">A Hard Day's Night</a>), and some sweetly drippy songs. I have this as the second film on a DVD of the also rather wonderful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-3pQztyaAQ">The London Nobody Knows</a>.</p>
<p>It also has the rather awesome Raleigh RSW 16 - now I'm fairly certain I'd look a prize pillock riding one but I generally don't worry too much about what I look like, and besides, in my head I would look brilliant. I've set up a saved search on eBay!<br />
