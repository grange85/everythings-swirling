<meta name="description" content="Just watched the BBC4 Carole King documentary which had a lovely start just rattlinmg through the amazing songs intercut with home movies, live clips, and a late 70s (or early 80s) interview - got a bit tired towards the end, particularly when it turned into an advert for the Carole King jukebox musical. But Carole is just adorable... and so many songs. Now listening to Now That Everything&#39;s Been Said by The City, which I&#39;d heard of, but not heard. I know I shouldn&#39;t say this out loud but I love Spotify! It&#39;s Carole King... in a band, and is just as good as that statement suggests it would be." />

Just watched the BBC4 Carole King documentary which had a lovely start just rattlinmg through the amazing songs intercut with home movies, live clips, and a late 70s (or early 80s) interview - got a bit tired towards the end, particularly when it turned into an advert for the Carole King jukebox musical.</p>
<p>But Carole is just adorable... and so many songs. Now listening to <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/1dhhTa6Pe8q3zd9zuuK5op">Now That Everything's Been Said by The City</a>, which I'd heard of, but not heard. I know I shouldn't say this out loud but I love Spotify!</p>
<p>It's Carole King... in a band, and is just as good as that statement suggests it would be.</p>
