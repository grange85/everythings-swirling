<meta name="description" content="After rattling through almost 130 posts during 2014 until I reached 50 ... I then stopped. Partly because the 50 albums project came to an end, and partly because the week after my birthday was so full and mind-bendingly awesome that I never got a chance... and by then I&#39;d fallen out of the habit. My family treated me to a Luna rarity for my birthday... which was a beautiful surprise http://instagram.com/p/oMmcsnPDHX/ The day after my 50th birthday (Sunday 18th) I went and saw Damon &amp; Naomi showing Naomi&#39;s film Fortune and performing, at Caf&eacute; Oto... at the end of that show, this happened... More about that evening on A Head Full of Wishes. The Wednesday, Thursday and Friday was spent following Dean Wareham around the bottom half of England, and ended with a particularly splendid night at the Islington Assembly Hall, and a bar and van afterwards - I babbled about that at length on A Head Full of Wishes if you care. http://instagram.com/p/oWzGxLLLTL/ The week after that I became the father of a seventeen year old boy. https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/14301132375/" />
