  <h1>Haiku Salut at St John's Church, Bethnal Green</h1>

  <p>Last night Hazel and I headed east to see the lovely Haiku Salut at St John's Church in Bethnal Green... again. Almost exactly a year after one of the best shows of 2013 (also possibly ever). It was just as wonderful last night, the "lamp show" had been extended to include some tellies and there were some new tunes. I took a few rubbish snaps, and did a half-time sketch.<br />
