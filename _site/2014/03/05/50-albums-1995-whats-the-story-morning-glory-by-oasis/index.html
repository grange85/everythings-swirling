I was fully prepared to hate it and was ready to vent my spleen (whatever the hell that means). Two observsations: So many singles! Considering I&#39;d never heard this album before I was surprisingly familiar with at least half the songs on it. One of these, Don&#39;t Look Back in Anger, I was even slightly fond of as it had been used for the closing scene of Our Friends in the North. I couldn&#39;t hate this album because it really had nothing to hate, given how offensive the Gallagher brothers are, they did manage to make a completely inoffensive album - you can&#39;t hate an album that manages to stir up no emotions. It&#39;s indie-music-wallpaper - it&#39;s just there. You can tap your foot, or nod your head, but not even Liam&#39;s whine, and hilarious pronunciayasheeyuhnsaah managed to engender any reaction from me. Nope, (What&#39;s The Story) Morning Glory? is just a pint of Young&#39;s Ordinary. It&#39;s a session beer you can drink all night and not get pissed.
