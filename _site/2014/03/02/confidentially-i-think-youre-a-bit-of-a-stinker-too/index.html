I've always been more fond of Hitchcock's British films than his later US ones (although some of them were quite good too), and recent gap filling (thanks to the BFIs season a couple of years back) has just reinforced things. There are at least four of his British films that vie for a place at the top of my fave Hitch film of all time list - currently that place is held by The Lady Vanishes, but only because it was on telly yesterday. I guess my favourite will always be whichever was the last one I saw.<br />
