  <h1>Chains: (What's The Story) Morning Glory? to Suburban Light</h1>

  <p>To-day I listened to Oasis' (What's The Story) Morning Glory? which I'll blog about later. To-day also, The Clientele announced they'll be <a href="http://www.mergerecords.com/suburban-light-reissue">releasing and improved and extended version of Suburban Light</a> (one of those things is CONSIDERABLY more exciting than the other!)</p>
<p>So here's how I get from one to another</p>

<p>BONUS - this started off as a "One shot" post but having changed it there was no space for Seam's rather good cover of Look Back in Anger... so I'm including it anyway.</p>
