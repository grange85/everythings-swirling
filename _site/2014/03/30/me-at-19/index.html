  <h1>Me at 19</h1>

  <p>Over on Facebook in one of those... 'social' things that happen I was asked to answer a few questions about a randomly offered age. I was given 19, I was disappointed... I was much cooler at 20 (and much cooler than that at 35!).</p>
<p><strong>The age I was given by Chris was 19... it was 1983</strong></p>
