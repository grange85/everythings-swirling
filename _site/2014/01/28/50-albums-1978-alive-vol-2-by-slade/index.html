That is utter nonsense, the album is a chunky and unsubtle and has no feeling of authenticity. Shame. I never saw Slade until their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slade#Comeback_and_heavy_metal_following_.281980.E2.80.9382.29">post-Reading '80 re-birth</a> and even then they were a fun live act... you wouldn't know it from Alive Vol, 2.</p>
<p>Also, the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thestand/5834196510/">album sleeve was awful</a>, which is why I chose not to use it above!</p>
