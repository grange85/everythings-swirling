<meta name="description" content="I have a fondness for Hammer films, I know they didn&#39;t churn out much of high quality, and to be honest a fair amount of their output is... questionable - probably in content and almost certainly in artistic merit, but they took a story, and told it. Over the last few months I&#39;ve re-watched a few Hammer films and I&#39;m inclined to think that She is one of the better ones - after all, you can&#39;t argue with that cast - Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Ursula Andress and light relief from Bernard Cribbens, and the story has some depth, which isn&#39;t always the case. There&#39;s an awesome set of screen grabs and memorabilia on Flickr SPOILERS AHEAD: The funny thing about She is that I haven&#39;t seen it for more than thirty (and probably closer to forty) years and can remember nothing about it ... except the end - which I remember extremely vividly. The blue flames, the fight, the aging of Ayesha, and Leo waiting - I remember all this so very clearly that it sort of spoiled my watching of it. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/morbius19/10861841516/&quot; title=&quot;She (MGM, 1965).

I have a fondness for Hammer films, I know they didn't churn out much of high quality, and to be honest a fair amount of their output is... questionable - probably in content and almost certainly in artistic merit, but they took a story, and told it. Over the last few months I've re-watched a few Hammer films and I'm inclined to think that She is one of the better ones - after all, you can't argue with that cast  - Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Ursula Andress and light relief from Bernard Cribbens, and the story has some depth, which isn't always the case.</p>

<p>SPOILERS AHEAD: The funny thing about She is that I haven't seen it for more than thirty (and probably closer to forty) years and can remember nothing about it ... except the end - which I remember extremely vividly.
