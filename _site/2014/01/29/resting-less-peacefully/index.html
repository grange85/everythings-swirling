<meta name="description" content="I never slept well last night, and the passing of Pete Seeger kept drifting in and out of my head, the following thoughts occurred to me. If there&#39;s an afterlife it&#39;s going to have a lot more singing in it now - I love the way Pete always made the song the star of a performance, and encouraged everyone to sing along. When someone has a full life and dies at a ripe old age I&#39;m inclined to feel that rather than mourning, we should be celebrating... but that doesn&#39;t apply for Pete Seeger - a world without Pete Seeger is a very much diminished one, we should be mourning for a world that has to get on without him. We should all rest a little less peacefully without Pete Seeger to be a champion of song and people. This afternoon I read the transcript of Pete&#39;s appearance before the HUAC in 1955 - in which he deals with incredible dignity an outrageous grilling - this made me smile... I assume he actually sang the last line - which makes it beautiful and funny and remarkable. MR. SEEGER: My answer is the same as before. Of course, I would be curious to know what you think of a song like this very great Negro spiritual, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Gonna Lay Down My Sword and Shield, Down by the Riverside.&rdquo; MR. TAVENNER: That is not at all responsive to my question. &lt;/blockquote&gt;" />

<p>I never slept well last night, and the passing of Pete Seeger kept drifting in and out of my head, the following thoughts occurred to me.</p>
<p>If there's an afterlife it's going to have a lot more singing in it now - I love the way Pete always made the song the star of a performance, and encouraged everyone to sing along.</p>
