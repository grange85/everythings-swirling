The first song is called Try (a Little Bit Harder) and therein lies the problem I've always had with Janis, she's always been trying a little bit to hard. Both in the pushing of her voice to its limits, and (more noticeably on this album than any other records of hers I've heard) the wanting to be Otis Redding. </p>
<p>Having said that, while this album does rather chug along at times, Janis's Otis-at-Monterey act does seem strangely affecting. The band seem a little removed from the groove but Janis is giving it her all, and even trying a little bit harder than that.</p>

She sounds so sweet and, to be honest, fragile - and then she starts singing and she's the total opposite of fragile... hard as nails.</p>
