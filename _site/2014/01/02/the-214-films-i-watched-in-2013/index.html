<p>Assuming my tagging was correct and complete (which it almost certainly wasn't) I watched:<br />
214 films, of which...<br />
38 were not in English<br />
23 were silent<br />
3 were released in 2013</p>
<p>I rated them all from one to ten - my ratings are irregular and sometimes unfathomable, periodically I decide that I'm rating too high and everything following gets rated lower... and then the numbers edge up again - so they really are nonsense... but as I've done it:</p>
<p>2 films were rated 10<br />
17 were rated 9<br />
40 were rated 8<br />
41 were rated 7<br />
43 were rated 6<br />
34 were rated 5<br />
24 were rated 4<br />
8 were rated 3<br />
3 were rated 2<br />
1 was rated 1</p>
