<meta name="description" content="Ringo walks towards Kew BridgeCoincidentally one of the first films I watched in 2014 was made in the year I was born, which got me thinking that what I&#39;m doing to records I could do for film. I love The Beatles, and mostly I love the sweet innocent charm of the early Beatles, and A Hard Day&#39;s Night is just 90 minutes of sweet innocent charm, maybe it was innovative in the way it was made, and maybe it was the &quot;godfather of MTV&quot; (&quot;I&#39;ve demanded a blood test&quot; said Dick Lester when confronted with that), and maybe with the sweet and charming Beatles we didn&#39;t really want to waste anything on a story - but maybe I wouldn&#39;t have minded a wee bit more substance. Ringo with the Brentford gas works But what I liked most was seeing little glimpses of West London in the year I was born (in West London). Kew where I work now, Brentford, where I worked for many years previously, Hammersmith Odeon where I found my own music when I was 15, and lots of London I don&#39;t know but love all the same. I think watching 50 films from 50 years might be trickier than listening to 50 albums, so don&#39;t be surprised if this series fizzles out at some point!" />
