<meta name="description" content="Saw the 1931 Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde at the BFI on Friday - and while visually and technically the film is a masterpiece, I can&#39;t help but be bothered by some rather questionable flaws in the plot (the most annoying being the supposedly totally bad Hyde character seeming to behave in a good way, and the supposedly good Jekyll being rather bad). Also it is a rather unpleasant film! But Miriam Hopkins was wonderful and Fredric March, was a terrific, if a little cartoon-y Hyde. Anyway, here are my two favourite Jekyll to Hyde transformations (and not a spot of CGI between them!): 1. The second transformation Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1931) 2. The first transformation from Dr Jekyll and Sister Hyde (1971)" />
