In May of this year I'll turn 50, to be honest the age thing has never really bothered me so I don't consider it a milestone or wince at the thought - but I thought I ought to celebrate it in some way so I thought I'd pick an album from every year of my life and just jot down random thoughts while listening to it - they won't be reviews, although I'm sure some might read like that. At the moment I have very little idea what 50 albums I'll choose, the intention is to pick from one or more of the following criteria</p>
<p>1. Albums I love<br />
2. Albums I've never really listened to but are considered classics<br />
3. Albums that I've never liked<br />
4. Albums that had an impact on me beyond just their music<br />
5. Albums that anyone cares to suggest I listen to<br />
6. Albums I've never listened to before</p>
<p>Some other categories will undoubtedly arrive, but if anyone has any albums they feel I should consider for this series please do!</p>
<p>The intention is to finish with a 2014 album on 17th May - I've a fairly good idea what album that might be.</p>
<p>I also know what the first one will be, because I'm listening to it right now!</p>
