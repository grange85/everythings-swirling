They&#39;re another band that I was aware of for a long time before I actually gave them any serious time, and by the time I did they were long gone. This, their second album, is a fine album. Listening to it makes me wonder why you don&#39;t see the young kids walking around with Chameleons T-shirts they way they walk around with Joy Division ones, or Smiths ones. I don&#39;t think any of Joy Division&#39;s albums are a patch on What Does Anything Mean? Basically. I guess they&#39;re the best band to come out of Manchester then?" />

I hardly ever listen to The Chameleons, and I know I should. They're another band that I was aware of for a long time before I actually gave them any serious time, and by the time I did they were long gone. </p>
<p>This, their second album, is a fine album. Listening to it makes me wonder why you don't see the young kids walking around with Chameleons T-shirts they way they walk around with Joy Division ones, or Smiths ones. I don't think any of Joy Division's albums are a patch on What Does Anything Mean? Basically.</p>
<p>I guess they're the best band to come out of Manchester then?</p>
