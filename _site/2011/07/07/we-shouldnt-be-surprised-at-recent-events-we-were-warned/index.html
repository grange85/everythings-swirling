Billy Bragg - It Says Here</a></p>
<pre>
It says here that the Unions will never learn<br />
It says here that the economy is on the upturn<br />
And it says here we should be proud<br />
That we are free<br />
And our free press reflects our democracy</p>
<p>Those braying voices on the right of the House<br />
Are echoed down the Street of Shame<br />
Where politics mix with bingo and tits<br />
In a strictly money and numbers game</p>
<p>Where they offer you a feature<br />
On stockings and suspenders<br />
Next to a call for stiffer penalties for sex offenders</p>
<p>It says here that this year's prince is born<br />
It says here do you ever wish<br />
That you were better informed<br />
And it says here that we can only stop the rot<br />
With a large dose of Law and Order<br />
And a touch of the short sharp shock</p>
<p>If this does not reflect your view you should understand<br />
That those who own the papers also own this land<br />
And they'd rather you believe<br />
In Coronation Street capers<br />
In the war of circulation, it sells newspapers<br />
Could it be an infringement<br />
Of the freedom of the press<br />
To print pictures of women in states of undress</p>
<p>When you wake up to the fact<br />
That your paper is Tory<br />
Just remember, there are two sides to every story<br />
</pre></p>
