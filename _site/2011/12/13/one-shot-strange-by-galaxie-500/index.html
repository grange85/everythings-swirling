  <h1>One shot: Strange by Galaxie 500</h1>

  <p>I love the Internet - it has made my life richer, it has found me friends, it has put me into in-real-life conversations with my heroes... and it has people on YouTube doing covers (<a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2009/01/20/i-love-living-in-the-future-1-covers-on-youtube/">I've expressed a love of this once before on this blog</a>).</p>
<p>Whereas the <em>proper band</em>'s Galaxie 500 <a href="http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2010/06/15/audio-a-fleet-of-tugboats/">cover of choice seems to be Tugboat</a>, the <em>webcam-soloist</em> seems to opt for Strange...</p>
<p>I came across danandkitty's cover of Strange on YouTube earlier in the week - and it's one of the most lovably sweet covers I've heard - just a man and his ukulele and his (clear) love of music -it is beautiful<br />
