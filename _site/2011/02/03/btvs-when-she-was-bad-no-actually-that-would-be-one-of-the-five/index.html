  <h1>BtVS: When She Was Bad / No, actually that would be one of the five</h1>

  <p>So... I wanted to pick up on the pop in Buffy when it came to pop I liked or noticed, or by bands I knew - but Cibo Matto's contributions to When She Was Bad were a little unimpressive. I bought Hazel the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miho_Hatori">Miho Hatori</a> solo album Ecdysis on the strength of the Buffy connection - and certainly like it more than the Cibo Matto songs in this episode.</p></p>
<p>Instead... I'll just quote one of my all time fave bits of Buffy dialogue (there are so many bits of dialogue in that list!)</p></p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Snyder</strong>:  There're some things I can just smell. It's like a sixth sense.<br />
<strong>Giles</strong>:  No, actually that would be one of the five.<br />
