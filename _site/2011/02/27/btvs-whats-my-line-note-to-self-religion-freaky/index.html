I try to deal with it because there're so many religious people out there and I feel I ought to respect their views... there are even people I like... a lot... who believe in all this mumbo-jumbo - but if ever I start to think about it...<shudder></p>
<p>Anyway... What's My Line is a pretty cool double header here are some thoughts...</p>
<ul>
<li>I know I'll say it every time but Oz = coolest</li>
