  <h1>BtVS: School Hard / A nice celebration with streamers and songs</h1>

  <p>I guess most people see School Hard's significance as being the arrival of someone else but for me it's Drusilla's first appearance that is key... Drusilla is such a ridiculously silly character - she has a silly accent which she uses to say such wonderfully silly things. School Hard offers only tantalising glimpses of what Dru will become in later in season two...</p></p>
