<meta name="description" content="I bought Back in the DHSS in 1985, when it came out, because everyone said I should... I listened to it a bit, then filed it away and then spent a lot of the subsequent years trying to pretend I&#39;d never heard it. I don&#39;t get why I was supposed to like it and I don&#39;t get why so many people do. Half Man Half Biscuit are a comedy outfit (I think it&#39;s insanely generous that their Wikipedia article describes them as satirical) and as such hold very little interest to me, I don&#39;t mind laughing - and I don&#39;t even mind laughing at song lyrics, but I prefer my humour to be a part of the song, not all there is of it. HMHB&#39;s humour is front and centre and pretty much revolves around throwing out pop-culture references and... well that&#39;s about it. If they can get a laugh purely out of mentioning Una Stubbs or Stevie Nicks, Bob Todd or Dairylea triangles then that&#39;s all they need to do - or perhaps make tiresome references to the TV of their born-in-the-60s audience and that&#39;s pretty much HMHB. &quot;Oh yes [snigger] we&#39;ll sing about Camberwick Green and mention drugs... and swear a bit - that&#39;ll be funny because all those people who watched it back then are probably smoking dope now... and swearing [giggle]&quot;. They are just the indie Barron Knights and I find it remarkable that they&#39;ve managed to carve a 30+ year career out of it... but then The Barron Knights are still working so I perhaps shouldn&#39;t really be surprised. I listened to this with a fair amount of skipping because it really was unbearable, juvenile nonsense." />
