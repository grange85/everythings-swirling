  <h1>BtVS: Witch / chewing and cheerleading</h1>

  <p>Chewing pens is horrid (or more accurately chewed pens are horrid)... Willow is lovely - I'm guessing that she's only chewing her pen here to allow her writers to clumsily make their point - I suspect that it will turn out subsequently that she's not a serial pen chewer... at least I hope so...<br />
