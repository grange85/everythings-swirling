  <h1>BtVS: Welcome to the Hellmouth / Sonic Boom</h1>

  <p>We're re-watching Buffy (again) because <a href="http://nikkistafford.blogspot.com/2010/11/great-buffy-rewatch.html">other folk are doing it too</a>... I'll try and post something about each episode - nothing profound or insightful - just something... if you want profound or insightful there's plenty out there. Hazel has already reviewed <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/category/btvs/">the whole of Buffy on Let's Fold Scarves</a>... not sure if she's planning on doing it again.</p>
<p>#1 - Welcome to the Hellmouth - separated at birth <a href="http://www.sonic-boom.info/">Sonic Boom</a> and Jesse<br />

<p>... hmm actually not so much now I look at it but an excuse to post a video of Spectrum/Pete Kember/Sonic Boom doing an acoustic cover of Spacemen 3's cover of The Red Crayola's Transparent Radiation (with Randall Nieman of Fuxa):</p>
