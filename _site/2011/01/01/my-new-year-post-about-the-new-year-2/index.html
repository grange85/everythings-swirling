  <h1>My new year post about The New Year</h1>

  <p>I just checked and my annual new year post about <a href="http://www.thenewyear.net/">The New Year</a> never happened last year, I'll blame the band for being ridiculously quiet (as opposed to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_8l_rLaj6s">beautifully quiet</a>). No hints at anything new but then it's only been two years and their previous work-rate suggests I should expect nothing until at least 2012!<br />
