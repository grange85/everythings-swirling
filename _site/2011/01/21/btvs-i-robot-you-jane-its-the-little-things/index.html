  <h1>BtVS: I Robot, You Jane / It's the little things</h1>

  <p>The great thing about Buffy the Vampire Slayer really isn't that silly old story malarkey, that nonsense has been known to upset the balance and make some later episodes unbearable. No, what's great about Buffy is... well everything else. It's the characters (a warm welcome to Jenny Calendar); it's the silly-gag-set-ups ("I'll be back in the Middle Ages"); it's the fizzy dialogue ("I think I pretty much capped it with that nuclear missile thing"); it's the bits you see; it's the bits you don't see - and mostly it's (things like) Xander falling off a fence... sadly that is something you'll have to dig out the DVD to fully appreciate...</p>
