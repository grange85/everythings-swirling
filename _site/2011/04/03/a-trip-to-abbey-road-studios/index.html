<meta name="description" content="On Thursday I made my third trip to Abbey Road Studios. I&#39;d managed, through Twitter-begging to wangle a couple of spots in the audience to see Lower Dens record a few songs for a TV show. We arrived as instructed at the studios at &quot;11am sharpish; if you&#39;re late, we can&#39;t let you in&quot; we then sat in and around the cafe for three-quarters of an hour waiting... We finally were let into Studio 1, and the audience of about 20 or so folk were sat in a circle around the band who stood facing each other in the middle of the studio. We were instructed to put on headphones so that we could hear a mix rather than just the kick drum - although frankly the sound through the headphones wasn&#39;t that great either, less of a mix and more of just shoving everything through at once. The band ran through three songs, and then ran through the same three songs again. It was a thoroughly enjoyable experience and I love Lower Dens, although I&#39;ll only be able to really appreciate what I heard when it goes out on the telly. There are a few great pics of the performance over here. Here is a video of a lower-key Lower Dens not in the the world&#39;s largest purpose built recording studio but doing a Tiny Desk Concert for NPR My previous two trips to Abbey Road were: 1991: for the mastering of Brian&#39;s You Don&#39;t Want a Boyfriend 7&quot; 9th August 1997: For the mastering of Luna&#39;s Dear Paulina 7&quot;" />

  <h1>A trip to Abbey Road Studios</h1>

  <p>On Thursday I made my third trip to Abbey Road Studios. I'd managed, through Twitter-begging to wangle a couple of spots in the audience to see <a href="http://lowerdens.com/">Lower Dens</a> record a few songs for <a href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/abbey-road-debuts">a TV show</a>. We arrived as instructed at the studios at "11am sharpish; if you're late, we can't let you in" we then sat in and around the cafe for three-quarters of an hour waiting...<br />

We finally were let into Studio 1, and the audience of about 20 or so folk were sat in a circle around the band who stood facing each other in the middle of the studio. We were instructed to put on headphones so that we could hear a mix rather than just the kick drum - although frankly the sound through the headphones wasn't that great either, less of a mix and  more of just shoving everything through at once. The band ran through three songs, and then ran through the same three songs again. It was a thoroughly enjoyable experience and I love Lower Dens, although I'll only be able to really appreciate what I heard when it goes out on the telly. </p>
<p>There are a few great <a href="http://twtgal.com/zpQx">pics of the performance over here</a>.</p>
