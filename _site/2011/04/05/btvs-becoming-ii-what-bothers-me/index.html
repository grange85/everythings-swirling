  <h1>BtVS: Becoming II / What bothers me</h1>

  <p>What bothers me is this:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Angelus</strong>: The blood on my hands must be my own. I am the key that will open up the door</blockquote><br />
And a little cut on the hand seems to do the trick!</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Whistler</strong>: Angel's the key. His blood will open the door to Hell. Acathla opens his big mouth, creates a vortex. Then only Angel's blood will close it. </blockquote><br />
So why couldn't a little cut on the hand have closed it again? And why did Buffy assume that she had to kill him?</p>
