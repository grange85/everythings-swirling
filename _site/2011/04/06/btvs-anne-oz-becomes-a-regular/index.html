  <h1>BtVS: Anne / Oz becomes a 'regular'</h1>

  <p>Sorry, my Oz-fixation is clearly out of hand. So here we are in season 3 and Seth moves from "Guest Starring Seth Green" to being a featured regular cast member. The buzz I get from seeing him up there with the big guns is tempered by knowing that this was the beginning of the end for Oz...</p>
<p>Here's what Seth said (from <a href="http://www.sethgreenonline.com/ask_011207.php">"Ask Seth" on his website</a>)...</p>
<blockquote><p>My character was conceived as a recurring character and by making me a regular, all of my time was dedicated to working on the show in scenes where my character seemed to be shoehorned into an inappropriate place so that I was regularly featured.
