  <h1>Glastonbury 2011 from my sofa #5: Morrissey</h1>

  <p>The thing about Morrissey is that he wouldn't be great if he wasn't a bit of a prat. It was that aspect of his character (and that aspect of Smiths fans) that always makes me forget just how much I do actually like him. I haven't seen Mozzer in a long, long time - probably <a href="http://www.songkick.com/concerts/666581-morrissey-at-o2-academy-brixton">this gig at the Brixton Academy in 1991</a>. I remember going to that one with a little apprehension... I also remember coming out of it loving his swagger and his attitude - and all those great songs. Obviously not so much to make me a fan because that was 20 years ago and I've not bothered to see him since... but enough...</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/festivals/glastonbury/2011/artists/morrissey/">Morrissey's Glastonbury set</a> was all that I like about him - all that swagger and all that attitude, those songs and that delivery, and that prat-undercurrent.</p>
