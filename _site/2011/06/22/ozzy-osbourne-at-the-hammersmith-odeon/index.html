<meta name="description" content="The first time I saw Ozzy was supporting Motorhead at Port Vale in &#39;81 - he blew me away... I was already a Sabbath fan having been sucked in with a copy of Paranoid I picked up at a jumble sale a couple of years previously, but had never managed to see them live. I saw Ozzy a couple more times in 81 and 82. The last time I saw Ozzy was at The Hammersmith Odeon in 82 or 83, it was in his hanging-midgets period, and at the very tail-end of my heavy metal period. I don&#39;t remember particularly enjoying it... maybe because I was growing up, but I suspect it was more to do with the pantomime that Ozzy had become by then, don&#39;t get me wrong... I&#39;m quite fond of the panto side of HM but I don&#39;t think he was doing it that well then. Over the last few years the Internet has turned me into a nostalgia fiend and seeing that Ozzy was back at the Hammy Odeon last night I found too hard to resist. I took my Nirvana-loving son along... because you can&#39;t really love Nirvana and not love Sabbath. I loved it. Here are some reasons why I maybe shouldn&#39;t have: Ozzy&#39;s voice is shot. His stage patter takes three forms: &quot;I can&#39;t fucking hear you&quot; &quot;Let me see your fucking hands&quot; &quot;I still can&#39;t fucking hear you&quot;&lt;/p&gt; He has an unhealthy fondness for the HM ballad - we were treated to three including one as an encore - who wants an effing ballad for an encore!? Drum solo &lt;/li&gt; Guitar solo - with wind effects! &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt; And here&#39;s why I did: The man is a legend, he&#39;s 62 years old and still loves what he does. His energy is boundless, his love for the audience and for what he does is admirable. He has fun on-stage. Of course it&#39;s still panto complete with buckets of water and a foam-spraying water-cannon, but it doesn&#39;t seem to matter - in fact it&#39;s probably better this way. If Ozzy dared to try and take himself seriously this would have been awful but he&#39;s better than that. Much much better. I also love how he hobbles around the stage like an old man in his carpet slippers on his way to put the kettle on. There&#39;re a few more pictures on Flickr: Here&#39;s my video of half of Fairies Wear Boots (until my battery died): And here&#39;s a better video of set-closer Paranoid:" />

<p>The first time I saw <a href="http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/heavy-metal-holocaust.html">Ozzy was supporting Motorhead at Port Vale in '81</a> - he blew me away... I was already a Sabbath fan having been sucked in with a copy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoid_%28album%29">Paranoid</a> I picked up at a jumble sale a couple of years previously, but had never managed to see them live. I saw Ozzy a couple more times in 81 and 82.</p>
<p>The last time I saw Ozzy was at The Hammersmith Odeon in 82 or 83, it was in his hanging-midgets period, and at the very tail-end of my heavy metal period. I don't remember particularly enjoying it... maybe because I was growing up, but I suspect it was more to do with the pantomime that Ozzy had become by then, don't get me wrong... I'm quite fond of the panto side of HM but I don't think he was doing it that well then.</p>
<p>Over the last few years the Internet has turned me into a nostalgia fiend and seeing that <a href="http://www.songkick.com/concerts/8802566-ozzy-osbourne-at-hmv-hammersmith-apollo">Ozzy was back at the Hammy Odeon last night</a> I found too hard to resist. I took my Nirvana-loving son along... because you can't really love Nirvana and not love Sabbath.<br />

I loved it. Here are some reasons why I maybe shouldn't have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ozzy's voice is shot.</li>
<li>His stage patter takes three forms:
<ul>
<li>"I can't fucking hear you"</li>
<li>"Let me see your fucking hands"</li>
<li>"I <em>still</em> can't fucking hear you"</li></ul></li></p>
<li>He has an unhealthy fondness for the HM ballad - we were treated to three including one as an encore - who wants an effing ballad for an encore!?</li>
<li>Drum solo <yawn></li>
<li>Guitar solo - with wind effects! <yawn x2></li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>And here's why I did:<br />
The man is a legend, he's 62 years old and still loves what he does. His energy is boundless, his love for the audience and for what he does is admirable. He has fun on-stage. Of course it's still panto complete with buckets of water and a foam-spraying water-cannon, but it doesn't seem to matter - in fact it's probably better this way. If Ozzy dared to try and take himself seriously this would have been awful but he's better than that. Much much better. I also love how he	hobbles around the stage like an old man in his carpet slippers on his way to put the kettle on.<br />
