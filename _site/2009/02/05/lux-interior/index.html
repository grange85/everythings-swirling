<meta name="description" content="Lux Interior, Cains Ballroom, 1980 There was a time in the early/mid 1980s after Fast Eddie Clarke left Motorhead and before The Pogues released Rum, Sodomy and the Lash were I was lost in a frustrated grasp to find a musical place for myself. For a short time during that aimless wander through the obscure and unloved musical movements I decided that maybe &#39;psychobilly&#39; could be where I settled. I went to three or four gigs at the Clarendon in Hammersmith and the energy and noise was exceptional, I saw The Guana Batz and The Meteors and a myriad of lesser (in fame and quality) bands. I sadly never got to see The Cramps but they were the band that defined that music more than any other, and I suspect that if I had seen them maybe I would have taken a different course. The Cramps albums got filed away and to be honest I&#39;ve listened to very little since then and had pretty much forgotten that nine months or so until I read today that Lux Interior had passed away and I was filled with a desire to hear The Cramps (thanks last.fm) and a regret that I never did see them live. &lt;/p&gt; R.I.P.
