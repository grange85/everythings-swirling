  <h1>My mum laundered hard!</h1>

  <p>As much as I miss my mum I don't miss her washing. Our school rugby kit was gold with a blue trim and from my second match I played in a murky greeny-yellow coloured kit. I had grey shirts that should have been white and grey-pink towels that once were red. My mum laundered hard!</p>
<p>Sadly I allowed her to wash hard my one Galaxie 500 T-shirt, bought at the <a href="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/gigography/show/776/">show at the Subterania</a> that still tops my best show of all time list.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure the print on the front lasted no more than one or two washes...but of course I kept and loved it, and yesterday I dug it out of the attic and (gently) washed it and posed in it.</p><br />

<p>It's still a wee bit tight so it'll probably be a few weeks before it gets a public outing (maybe I'll wear it to Dunfermline in July).</p></p>
