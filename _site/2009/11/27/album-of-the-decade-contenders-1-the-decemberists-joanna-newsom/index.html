<meta name="description" content="I quickly skimmed through my Songbird library pulling out the albums that I might consider for my album of the decade list. With very little effort I reached 50... and there&#39;ll be more. Here are some quick thoughts on a few of them... Castaways &amp; Cutouts, Her Majesty The Decemberists, Picaresque - The DecemberistsI loved the first three albums by The Decemberists and rate their first show at The Water Rats as one of the gigs of the decade. But the relationship has always been an awkward one. Something bothered me and still does. I listen to all of these albums rarely now but still love them when I do. The Milk Eyed Mender, Ys - Joanna NewsomYs is exceptional, I don&#39;t listen to it that often because it takes requires a commitment that I don&#39;t often have. All the things I said before still apply. It is an album so far removed from anything else that it really requires a list of its own. So when the need arises I generally reach for The Milk Eyed Mender. &lt;/p&gt;" />
