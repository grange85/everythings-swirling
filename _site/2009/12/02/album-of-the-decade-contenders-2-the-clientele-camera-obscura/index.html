<p>The Clientele might well be my "band of the decade." I've certainly seen them more than any other band this decade, having first seen them in 2001 (probably even earlier - and last seen them a week ago). All the albums they've released in that time, including The Violet Hour which isn't listed above because I chose an arbitrary limit of three per artist in my list, is a classic. The one I love most differs from day-to-day.</p>

<p>Camera Obscura's first two albums had a sweetness that I think subsequently got lost. Maybe with the departure of John they took on a more professional feel that took away a little of that sweet naive appeal.  I still love them but not as much as I loved them in 2003</p>
