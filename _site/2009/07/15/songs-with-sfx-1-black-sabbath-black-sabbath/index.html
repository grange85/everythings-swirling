<meta name="description" content="I threw together a post last week of &quot;my top 6&quot; songs with sound effects but it seemed a bit wasteful to just bundle together a few songs with SFX off the top of my head - there are so many more and some much better - so here&#39;s the first of another ongoing series on Everything&#39;s Swirling... Unquestionably the best beginning to a heavy metal song (if not any song) is the beginning of Black Sabbath&#39;s eponymous track from their eponymous debut album. It has hammering rain, rumbles of thunder and a church bell chiming in the distance... and the most fantastic opening riff. There might be many great sound effects songs on their way in this series (or possibly not) but none will be greater than this one! Sadly this video doesn&#39;t have the full intro and nor does the track on last.fm - but I&#39;ve just found it on blip.fm. &lt;/param&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;" />

  <h1>Songs with SFX #1: Black Sabbath - Black Sabbath</h1>

  <p>I threw together <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2009/07/03/my-top-6-songs-with-sfx/">a post last week of "my top 6" songs with sound effects</a> but it seemed a bit wasteful to just bundle together a few songs with SFX off the top of my head - there are so many more and some much better - so here's the first of another ongoing series on Everything's Swirling...</p>
<p>Unquestionably the best beginning to a heavy metal song (if not any song) is the beginning of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a>'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath_(song)">eponymous track</a> from their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath_(album)">eponymous debut album</a>. It has hammering rain, rumbles of thunder and a church bell chiming in the distance... and the most fantastic opening riff. There might be many great sound effects songs on their way in this series (or possibly not) but none will be greater than this one!</p>
<p>Sadly this video doesn't have the full intro and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Black+Sabbath/Black+Sabbath/Black+Sabbath">nor does the track on last.fm</a> - but I've <a href="http://blip.fm/profile/grange85/blip/16741760">just found it on blip.fm</a>.<br />
