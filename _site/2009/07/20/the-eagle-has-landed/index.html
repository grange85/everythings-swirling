<p>Adam and I have been fascinated by the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission to the moon. I have vague memories of watching it first time around - although those memories could easily have been of later missions. We've spent a lot of time listening to the "as live" broadcasts played on the <a href="http://wechoosethemoon.com">We Choose the Moon</a> website (although some "as live" telly would have been nicer). An hour or so (+40 years) back the Eagle landed in the Sea of Tranquility... I was thrilled!</p></p>
<p>Over the last few days I've been randomly using Blip.fm (and The Hype Machine) to post vaguely related songs to Twitter... for no one's enjoyment of my own and for the same reason I'll repost here. I was going to create a Spotify playlist but it failed at the first hurdle (ballboy) so I shan't bother...</p></p>
