What was the first concert you attended? (Think way back). - Motorhead @ The Hammersmith Odeon in 1979. What was the most recent concert you attended? - Damon &amp; Naomi @ The Luminaire in January Name of first album purchased? - Snoopy Vs The Red Baron by The Hotshots What format was that album in (LP, cassette, 8-track, CD, 45, iTunes, etc)? - 7&quot; single What was the theme song played at your prom/formal/last high school dance? - n/a What is the last song you played on your ipod (or other music device)? - Perversion by Stereolab What music is a guilty pleasure (that you mostly keep quiet about)? - I&#39;m not sure I feel guilty about anything - I like stuff that people mightn&#39;t expect - some musicals. What song, group, musician or genre do you absolutely dislike? - Songs where the video involves people dancing in rows towards the camera What was your favourite radio station in school? - BBC Radio 1 What music did your parents listen to when you were a child? Mum = Daniel O&#39;Donnell and Eoin McLove - she also liked classic country music like Dolly and Tammy and Don Williams Dad = Trad jazz, rock and roll - pretty much anything! Impressions then?; I hated most of what my mum listened to and spent a lot of time trying to turn her onto better things. Dad&#39;s hoarding of music had a huge influence on me. Impressions now?: Still hate most of the music my mum loved and still appreciate my dad&#39;s even thought there was a lot of rubbish in amongst it all.

No Ever play air guitar? - Yes In public? - Yes Ever do karaoke? No Did you ever drive anyone to distraction because you played a song over and over again? Name it. - Don&#39;t think so - maybe the Dear Paulina single when Dean first sent me the tape. Have you ever sung the words to a song aloud and then found out you had the words wrong? What was it? - Yes - most recently discovering that Nick Drake never held an ocean in the palm of his hand. What music do you wish you knew more about? - Almost everything. What is your most memorable music experience? - Meeting (and liking) all three members of Galaxie 500 - maybe the arse-print incident What was your High School or College fight song? I don&#39;t understand the question, and I won&#39;t respond to it I don&#39;t know what that is nor do I care to find out. (that was the quote I meant!) Did you lie on any of the questions above?
