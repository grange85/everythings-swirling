  <h1>Winslow Homer in Cullercoats #01</h1>

  <p>Before we moved to the North East we took a few trips up here and each time I’d post a pic of the beach at Cullercoats, and each time my pal Andrew would mention Winslow Homer, and each time I’d have to Google to find out who he was! I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winslow_Homer">suggest you do the same</a> because this is a quick filler post not me writing a biography!</p>

<p>I liked what I saw, I even tried (and failed) to copy some of his art (in my own scribbly ways) - but this isn’t about my half-baked attempts - this is about his lovely (and not half-baked) paintings.</p>
