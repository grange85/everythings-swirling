  <h1>Discovery Museum</h1>

  <p>Andy and I visited the <a href="https://discoverymuseum.org.uk/">Discovery Museum</a> which is housed in the former Co-operative Wholesale Society Headquarters for the Northern Region. It was a fascinating way to spend a couple of hours particularly in the galleries focusing on social history.</p>

<p>My favourite thing was the gigantic relief map (or model) made for the 1929 North East Coast Exhibition (described by Pathé as a miniature Wembley).</p>
