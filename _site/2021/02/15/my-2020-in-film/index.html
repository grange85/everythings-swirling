<p>So in 2020 we stayed in… a lot - and I watched a lot of films - more than in any year since I’ve been keeping a log (and I can’t imagine any year before then when I saw more). Here’s a quick summary.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I watched 389 films</li>
  <li>The average score of the films I watched was 5.89 / 10</li>
  <li>I saw 0.79% of them on the big screen</li>
  <li>and watched almost a quarter of them on Talking Pictures TV</li>
  <li>57% of the films I watched were from before I was born</li>
  <li>7 were animated and 31 were musicals</li>
  <li>88.9% of films were in English<br />
other langugaes:
    <ul>
      <li>Bengali (1)</li>
      <li>Polish (2)</li>
      <li>Japanese (2)</li>
      <li>Arabic (4)</li>
      <li>Telegu (1)</li>
      <li>Finnish (1)</li>
      <li>French (10)</li>
      <li>Russian (1)</li>
      <li>German (1)</li>
      <li>Hindi (8)</li>
      <li>Spanish (2)</li>
      <li>Silent (8)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All the films I rated ten were films I’d seen before</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Matter of Life and Death (1946)</li>
  <li>Underground (1928) <em>that was one of the three on the big screen film!</em></li>
  <li>Ice Cold in Alex (1958)</li>
  <li>Black Narcissus (1947)</li>
  <li>Some Like It Hot (1959)</li>
</ul>

<p>The highest rated film I’d not seen before was</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cairo Station (1958, Youssef Chahine) <em>which got a nine</em></li>
</ul>
