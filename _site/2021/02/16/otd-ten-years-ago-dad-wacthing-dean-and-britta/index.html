Ten years ago today I took my dad (well, he took me) to see Dean &amp; Britta playing Galaxie 500 in Brighton:</li>
</ul>

<p>We turned up early and watched the soundcheck</p>

<p>The show was lovely - <a href="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2011/02/17/review-dean-wareham-plays-galaxie-500-in-brighton/">I wrote about it at the time on <abbr title="a" head="" full="" of="" wishes="">AHFoW</abbr></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Soundcheck over, dad scrounged a beer, told Britta her hat looked silly and told Dean about seeing Bill Haley and the Comets… I stood by, quiet and uncomfortable!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They finished the set with a storming Ceremony:</p>

<p>Dean wrote about my in his blog at the time</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Andy Aldridge brought his Dad along to the show and we enjoyed meeting him. Andy’s Dad told me after the show that I should let Britta sing more and it’s true she has a lovely voice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>… and mentioned it during one of last year’s livestreamed shows … so, it seems my dad made an impression!?</p>
