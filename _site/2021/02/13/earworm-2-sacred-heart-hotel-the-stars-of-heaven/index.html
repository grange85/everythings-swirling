I have a copy of Sacred Heart Hotel picked up from a Record and Tape Exchange and that was all I knew ~ until a few years ago when they put both albums on the internet for free.

<p>I saw The Stars of Heaven just once - Ken took me (or more accurately made me take him) along to The Mean Fiddler in Harlesden for what I suspect was their last show ~ or at least their last London show - I guess sometime in 1990?</p>

<p>I have a copy of Sacred Heart Hotel picked up from a Record and Tape Exchange and that was all I knew ~ until a few years ago when they put both albums on the internet for free.</p>

<p>Now you can <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/03Up66Zd0A48MVVqOpMat2?si=BABn_5muTGCWX8E-hdD3CQ">hear them on Spotify</a></p>

<p>Nice clip of them playing <a href="https://www.rte.ie/archives/2020/1013/1171249-the-stars-of-heaven/">Every Other Day (from their second album) on Anything Goes</a></p>
