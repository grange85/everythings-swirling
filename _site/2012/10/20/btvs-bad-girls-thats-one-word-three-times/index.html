I thought I remembered Faith vigorously washing her hands and was going to link it in with this piece by Rose George on how we could do with being a little more diligent on that front - but when I went to grab a screencap it showed Faith vigorously washing her top.

  <h1>BtVS: Bad Girls / That's one word three times</h1>

  <p>SO in Bad Girls...</p>
<p>...Wesley arrives, Faith and Buffy do the silly hands in the air dancing, a blobby villain gets fritzed and Faith kills a human... and goes bad. Despite all that, it was a bit forgettable... not much great dialog, not a great deal to laugh at, and it's hard to care.<br />

<p><strong>Rules of Buffy:</strong><br />
I pondered making the deputy mayor's demise an example of <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2011/01/15/btvs-the-pack-rip-principal-flutie/">Rule of Buffy #1</a> - but he wasn't really nice.</p>
<p>Maybe too early to say but could be a new Rule of Buffy - "If you dance with your hands above your head you're probably bad"</p>
