Next up the ever fantastic The Feelies - the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MiTZoE59_g">cover turned up on their first album</a> - and they've been playing regularly during the epic sets during their recent reunion - which this weekend involves <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2012/05/feelies_playing.html">three nights at Maxwell's in Hoboken</a> sadly too far from London!<br />
