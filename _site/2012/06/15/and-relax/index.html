  <h1>... and relax</h1>

  <p>Today I took an exam to finish of my OU mathematics course (MS221) - this has eaten up my evenings and weekends over the last few weeks, as well as causing me the sort of stress I don't think I want... particularly as I was only doing the course for my own pleasure - at some point it stopped being a pleasure.</p>
<p>This is what MS221 has taken from me which today I reclaim</p>
<p>Books - I'm not a prolific reader - I like reading, it's just that I'm very slow at it - I have a pile of books to read plus a virtual pile on my Kindle.</p>
<p>Photography - In the months since I started MS221 I have acquired a Yashica Mat TLR, a couple of other old cameras, plus an enlarger - all unused - the enlarger (sadly only a 35mm one and I have so many medium format cameras!) is on the floor behind me! I'm looking forward to making use of that.</p>
<p>Games - Adam and Hazel bought me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_3:_Drake%27s_Deception">Uncharted 3</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkham_City">Batman: Arkham City</a> for Christmas... both are unopened waiting for the time.</p>
<p>Films/TV - Oh we have so much telly to watch it's scary, Hazel bought Rock Follies, I got a Blu-Ray of the very wonderful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausica%C3%A4_of_the_Valley_of_the_Wind_%28film%29">Nausica&auml; of the Valley of the Wind</a> for Christmas, also still in it's wrap.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk">A Head Full of Wishes</a> - after axing the AHFoW wiki and bringing the <a href="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/">old database</a> back into life - it's in sore need of a complete re-write - and to get some of the great pictures I've been sent over the years back on-line.</p>
<p>So... I reclaim my life.</p>
