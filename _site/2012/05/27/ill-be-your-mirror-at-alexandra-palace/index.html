<meta name="description" content="Here are a few thoughts on my day spent at the lovely Alexandra Palace in north London where All Tomorrows Parties were hosting a three day festival: Somehow ATP have managed to put on a festival that involves no women artists - certainly on the whole of Saturday I saw most performances and never saw a single woman on a stage (and I&#39;m aware that at least three of the acts I never saw were all male) - this is a very poor show and made the whole event seem so... laddish. The whole event was also relentlessly loud - I&#39;d have loved to have had a day of variation, but it seems that no care had been taken in constructing the bill and instead they just grabbed a bunch of loud blokes with loud guitars (or a loud violin). I actually love many of the artists I saw yesterday but by the end I was yearning for something sweet and gentle. We arrived, grabbed some (obviously nsanely overpriced) food and checked the main stage, the running order told us this was Floor - we lasted a song and then headed to the Panorama Room to watch the &quot;metal bingo&quot;. We also checked out Chavez, also unimpressed. Irmin Schmidt of Can then played us a few tracks from the forthcoming &quot;Lost Tapes&quot; collection - which was good - but the room was getting too hot so we headed out to try and find ice-cream. We returned for the excellent Codeine, a band I&#39;ve long loved but had never managed to see before... they were as good as expected but would have benefited from a smaller stage in a more appropriate environment. Mudhoney were pretty much exactly what I&#39;d expected... which is not a bad thing... well, exactly what I&#39;d expected until the drum solo - last drum solo I saw I walked out of - leave solo-ing to the metal and jazz lot... it&#39;s OK-ish then. Also, nice to know there&#39;s an Iggy ready to step into Iggy&#39;s shoes when (if) he decides to retire! Dirty Three were probably great -but they were also loud and by now I was desperate for some respite, so we retired to the Panorama Room to hear Balam Acab make some enjoyable and interesting electronic noodles. Finally Mogwai, another band I&#39;ve followed for years but I&#39;d never got around to seeing. They made a lot of noise and it was great, but I was done. The end came just about when it needed to, and thankfully we were spared an encore." />

<p>Here are a few thoughts on my day spent at the lovely Alexandra Palace in north London where All Tomorrows Parties were hosting a three day festival:</p>
<p>Somehow ATP have managed to put on a festival that involves no women artists - certainly on the whole of Saturday I saw most performances and never saw a single woman on a stage (and I'm aware that at least three of the acts I never saw were all male) - this is a very poor show and made the whole event seem so... laddish.</p>
<p>The whole event was also relentlessly loud - I'd have loved to have had a day of variation, but it seems that no care had been taken in constructing the bill and instead they just grabbed a bunch of loud blokes with loud guitars (or a loud violin). I actually love many of the artists I saw yesterday but by the end I was yearning for something sweet and gentle.</p>
<p>We arrived, grabbed some (obviously nsanely overpriced) food and checked the main stage, the running order told us this was Floor - we lasted a song and then headed to the Panorama Room to watch the "metal bingo". We also checked out Chavez, also unimpressed.<br />
