<meta name="description" content="Damon Krukowski (of Galaxie 500*) wrote a very interesting and quite depressing article on Pitchfork, about how sites like Pandora and Spotify remunerate artists. But what can I, as a fan, music lover, listener, do about it - here are some thoughts - they are mine and mine alone, they are off the top of my head and a little muddled. I hate CDs, I always hated them, they are ghastly little bits of landfill - environmental timebombs. I have vowed to never buy another CD. I still buy records occasionally, for bands I love or for exceptionally beautiful artifacts. &lt;/p&gt; I adore a world where the MUSIC is more important than the ARTIFACT I adore ARTIFACTS I want to give money to artists I love I want a &quot;radio&quot; where I control what I listen to - that is music that I want to listen to but have no desire to own. I want the makers of this music to get some benefit of my listening... but this isn&#39;t the same as the point above. &lt;/p&gt; I love that Spotify allows me to shoot off in bizarre directions, try stuff out, find the obscure and odd. I believe there is a difference between buying a track and listening to a track on Spotify I like to buy things - even things that don&#39;t have a physical manifestation. I love what Kristin Hersh has done using her &quot;Strange Angels&quot; - a bunch of fans who pay a regular amount to her purely to enable her to make music - any perks are a bonus - the main thing is to allow a great artist to make art. I know that while I can afford to do that for SOME artists I love I couldn&#39;t afford to do it for ALL artists I love. I don&#39;t want to be a leech. I don&#39;t believe musicians have a right to fame and fortune and anyone who makes music with that as a goal is probably not someone I&#39;d respect (although I suspect there are many who do). Kristin Hersh released her last album as a book with a download - I loved that! I love books. Kristin Hersh is releasing her next album as a book with a CD - I love that much less. I love that this new age is encouraging artists to get innovative with how they get music to us. I love Bandcamp. I love the idea of a world built on trust and honesty - even if there are people who are neither trustworthy or honest. I know that people steal music, but I also know they always did. I don&#39;t go to many gigs these days. I still buy and wear band T-shirts. I want to help. * - Put there on the off-chance someone doesn&#39;t know me arrives here!" />
