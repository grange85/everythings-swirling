Joyce: You got good albums. Giles: Yeah, they&#39;re okay. Joyce: Do you like Seals and Croft? Giles: &lt;/em&gt; Joyce: Yeah, me neither.&lt;/p&gt; I love that Giles is a music snob - and while he doesn&#39;t necessarily have great taste (that&#39;s proved later... in a coffee shop) - we do know that he has Cream and The Velvet Underground in his record collection so Joyce&#39;s &quot;you got good albums&quot; is about right. Of course Tales of Brave Ulysses isn&#39;t Cream&#39;s finest hour - and frankly their finest hour was on the Lulu show in 1969... only lasted about a minute (you need to wait (or skip) seven and a half minutes into this clip) and didn&#39;t have any of them on stage!" />

<p><strong>Joyce: </strong> You got good albums.<br />
<strong>Giles: </strong> Yeah, they're okay.<br />
<strong>Joyce: </strong> Do you like Seals and Croft?<br />
<strong>Giles: </strong><em> <gives Joyce a look></em><br />
<strong>Joyce: </strong> Yeah, me neither.</p>
<p>I love that Giles is a music snob - and while he doesn't necessarily have great taste (that's proved later... in a coffee shop) - we do know that  he has Cream and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/431259455/">The Velvet Underground in his record collection</a> so Joyce's "you got good albums" is about right.</p>
<p>Of course Tales of Brave Ulysses isn't Cream's finest hour - and frankly their finest hour was on the Lulu show in 1969... only lasted about a minute (you need to wait (or skip) seven and a half minutes into this clip) and didn't have any of them on stage!<br />
