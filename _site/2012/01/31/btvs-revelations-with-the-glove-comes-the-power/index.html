I&#39;d have loved to have seen her doing more English things with Giles - Giles needs more Englishness around him and Gwendolyn was just so gorgeously and perfectly English... there is talk in the council that you have become a bit too... American&lt;/blockquote&gt; She deserved a nice three or four episode arc instead of being fried within one. The pictures are fun to look at, Mr. Giles, but one really ought to read the nice words as well&lt;/blockquote&gt; Faith! A word of advice, you&#39;re an idiot.&lt;/blockquote&gt; As an aside... while I thoroughly appreciate Screencap Paradise for providing me with most of the pics on this site - it&#39;s nowhere near as much fun as this Unflattering Buffy Screencaps." />
