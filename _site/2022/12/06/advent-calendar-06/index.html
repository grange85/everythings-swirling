<p>We had Nina and Frederik records when I was growing up, although that’s not some sort of parental sign of approval - we just had craploads of records acquired from who knows where over many years. I’m not sure I’ve really listened to them up until now … and frankly they’re not that great, not bad, just … dull.</p>

<p>I have an EP (Christmas at Home) and a single of White Christmas - I’ll spare you them all and just post their two UK xmas hits! Mary’s Boy Child is sung in West Indian accent which seems strange for a couple of very white northern europeans.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfdsOwBf7UQ">Nina and Frederik - Mary’s Boy Child</a> - #26 - 1959</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qudi6JqE-M">Nina and Frederik - Little Donkey</a> - #3 - 1960</li>
</ul>

<p>OK - just noticed that White Christmas has a John Barry arrangement which does lift it head and shoulders above the Christmas at Home EP!</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OH9RcUZJGs">Nina and Frederik - White Christmas</a> - Didn’t chart - 1962</li>
</ul>

<p>The couple separated in the mid-70s and Frederik and his second wife were shot in The Phillipines in 1994 - the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-frederik-van-pallandt-1437924.html">obit in The Independent</a> mentions the death like it was just another routine way of dying - which seems very odd. A post on IMDB suggests it was river pirates!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though the couple separated and eventually divorced in 1976, they remained friends until Frederik’s death, from gunshot wounds, along with his second wife, Susannah. It was a measure of their continuing closeness that Nina flew out to the Philippines to bring his body home to Europe.</p>
