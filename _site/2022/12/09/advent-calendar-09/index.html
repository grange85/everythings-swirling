<p>Just Like Christmas is the Christmas Low track that invariably gets played but this seven inch single that came out a couple of years earlier is the most magical of Low’s contribution to the season.</p>

<p>If You Were Born Today (Song For Little Baby Jesus) is utterly heartbreaking and so perfectly Low (which Just Like Christmas ain’t) - sung by Alan but Mimi’s harmonies are just heartbreaking, that and the lyrics:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you were born today<br />
We’d kill you by age eight<br />
Never get the chance to say<br />
“Joy to the world, and peace on the earth”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Blue Christmas is obviously a cover of the song most famously performed by Elvis - and Mimi takes the lead for this and she makes her Blue Christmas sadder, more desloate, than any versions that have gone before it.</p>

<p>We lost Mimi a few weeks ago - and such a loss, It’ll make Low’s heartbreaking Christmas songs even sadder.</p>

</ul>

<p>Obv the whole of the <a href="https://lowtheband.bandcamp.com/album/christmas">Christmas EP</a> is great and has both of the above, and Just Like Christmas, and a bunch more seasonal gems.</p>
