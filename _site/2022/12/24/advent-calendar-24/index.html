<p>So … we come to one of my favourite Christmas songs - not sure if this is a surprise or not since I have been singing its praises on social-media for a few years - not that I suspect anyone has noticed - but it’s a work of genius (the genius that is Mike Batt) - the problem with it is that most people will probably shrug it off as a novelty song from a kids TV show - but it has the most beautiful opening lyric imaginable:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Open your eyes, look to the skies when you’re lonely<br />
There will be stars shining for you</p>
</blockquote>

<p>True it doesn’t get better than that, but that’s a hell of an opening. The rest is a more conventional celebration of Christmas, the snow, the warmth after the snow, the laughter and the hope. And the reassurance that the “whole wide world is Wombling too”.</p>

<p>Whatever you want your Christmas to be is the right way to do Christmas - and the whole wide world is (or should be) behind your decision.</p>

<p>Have a Wombling Merry Christmas</p>
