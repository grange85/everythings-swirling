<p>The golden age of Christmas pop was clearly the mid-70s but I haven’t really raided that period as much as I expected. Mud are so very mid-70s it would be painful to imagine them in any other era, but their contribution to the canon is a rather tired sounding one. It certainly doesn’t have the vibrancy of their best hits and its way to sugary for my taste.</p>

<p>Despite that I do own two copies … mostly because I love how seasonal the sleeves are.</p>
