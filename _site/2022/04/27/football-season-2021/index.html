  <h1>A football season in the North East</h1>

  <p>I’m not sure what I like about football - pretty certain it’s not what most people like about it. But I do rather love non-league (and lower league) football, maybe because, as a Wimbledon fan, most of my football watching has been on sparsely populated terraces.</p>

<p>I had been to very few matches in the years before we moved North, just the odd Wimbledon match when Adam could talk me into it, but arriving in the North East seemed to fire something unexpected and found me spending a few weekends and evenings standing on sparsely populated terraces… here’s a very quick round up.</p>
