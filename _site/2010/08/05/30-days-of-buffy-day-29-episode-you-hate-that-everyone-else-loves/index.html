Luckily Hazel has again pointed me at this ordered list of Buffy episodes for my perusal so I&#39;ll start reading and stop as soon as I hit one I was less than enamoured with. Sit tight... Oh... and there it is at #25 - The Prom - creepy and dull and a little bit of an illusion-buster of an episode. Mostly ebcause of the umbrella thing. The umbrella thing was sad and ridiculous and bothered me when I frist saw it and bothers me still. I can&#39;t imagine that it ranks as high as 25 but maybe that&#39;s all the romantics marking up for the dance... That was easier than expected. &lt;/p&gt;" />
