Great gig, The Sid Presley Experience split and half of them went onto form The Godfathers who were the not the same (despite I think trying to be) and by then I&#39;d moved on. This blog post has collected together pretty much the complete works of The SPE including both singles, radio sessions and some live stuff. &lt;/param&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;" />

I saw The Sid Presley Experience three or four times in 1984 to 1985 the most memorable was the first time at The Marquee (<a href="http://www.themarqueeclub.net/history-the-wardour-st-days-1964-1988">when it was in Wardour Street</a>). The band were young, the drummer was probably only about 14. The Marquee was a sweatbox, horrid and dark and damp - the walls were sopping wet and the floor was sticky. During the encore - which I think was Public Enemy Number One again because they'd run out of songs - the drummer passed out... I think they revived him and carried on.</p>
