<meta name="description" content="Artists of the noughts Kristin Hersh - For more than just the music she made - for being the person she is and for painting a future that I can believe in. &lt;/p&gt; Nina Nastasia - Never disappointing on record and one show that I will rate amongst my most memorable. If pushed You Follow Me might be my album of the decade. &lt;/p&gt; The Clientele - Probably the band I&#39;ve seen most over the decade, and not disappointed, not even once... and a run of perfect albums over that time too. &lt;/p&gt; Damon &amp; Naomi, Luna, Dean &amp; Britta - I consider myself very lucky that in Galaxie 500&#39;s demise I was gifted with three acts I adore and the chance to be friends with some of the nicest people. &lt;/p&gt; Joanna Newsom - Two stunning albums, one great (and one fairtly good) performance. Ys could have been album of the decade but I&#39;m now unable to put it into lists or charts - it can&#39;t be found next to anything else. &lt;/p&gt; Honourable mention to Ballboy, Yo La Tengo, The Decemberists &lt;/p&gt; Albums of &#39;09 The Xx - The snob in me is bothered by just how popular The Xx have become. But I still keep listening to the album and it really is quite excellent. &lt;/p&gt; The Pains of Being Pure at Heart - This year has been sprinkled liberally with nostalgia - whether it has been me dipping into my metal past with Sabbath and Hawkwind, or spending time with Lush, Pale Saints, Bleach and Drugstore - the late 80s and early 90s nostalgia was fueled by The Pains... &lt;/p&gt; 13 Most Beautiful... - The DVD is good but I&#39;ve mostly listened to 13 Most Beautiful as an album, having ripped the audio from the DVD. It works beyond the films. &lt;/p&gt; There were plenty of others too... Julie Doiron, Cheval Sombre, The Clientele, Wye Oak, School of Seven Bells etc. &lt;/p&gt; Gigs of &#39;09 13 Most Beautiful... - Carnegie Hall - Not just for the show - although that was exceptional, but for the event, for the before and the after. And for Tugboat as an encore. &lt;/p&gt; Damon &amp; Naomi - The Luminaire/Cafe OTO - two great shows although I had to leave the second one early so the Luminaire show takes the prize. &lt;/p&gt; Dean &amp; Britta - St Giles - More for what it was because if I think to hard there were disappointments - the venue worked better as an idea than in reality. But lovely all the same. &lt;/p&gt; Most shows I went to this year were wonderful so I&#39;ll chip in honourable mention to Julie Doiron, Pastels/Tenniscoats, The Clientele, Spiritualized &lt;/p&gt;" />
