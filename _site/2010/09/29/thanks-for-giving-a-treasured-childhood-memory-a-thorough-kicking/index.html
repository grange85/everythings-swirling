<meta name="description" content="In 2001 I first saw the &quot;Special Edition&quot; of Star Wars (aka Star Wars IV: A New Hope)... I was not happy - here&#39;s the open-letter to George Lucas that I wrote as a review on IMDB. Given that he&#39;s now planning on doing it all over again in 3D I thought I&#39;d republish it - Mr Lucas - all this still applies ... please stop fucking about with my childhood. Dear George, I remember seeing Star Wars on its first release and being completely immersed in the story, the characters, the effects - to a thirteen year old it was wonderful, I saw it a couple of times after and the magic never diminished. BUT THEN at the weekend I sat down and saw this &quot;new&quot; film with added effects that more often than not stuck out like a sore thumb. Additions that somehow said &quot;remember that film you loved so much...well actually it wasn&#39;t good enough&quot;. Well Mr Lucas it WAS good enough, it didn&#39;t need some hokey special effects to make it better - for me it had the opposite effect. In particular the scene with Han and Jabba looked dreadful - it repeated (almost verbatim) a previous scene, made Jabba seem insignificant and unthreatening and made poor Harrison Ford look like a second-rate actor who didn&#39;t know where to look. Sure I still enjoyed the film - but the additions (and of course the inevitable subtractions) meant that there was no longer any magic here for me. Just because you can do this it doesn&#39;t mean you should. You had the opportunity to show off all your special effects muscle in The Phantom Menace, why did you feel the need to meddle with your &quot;back-catalogue&quot; to try and produce a homogeneous mass of work rather than a timeline through recent film history. Your attempts failed and now you have a half-decent film where there was once a great one. Thanks also for giving a treasured childhood memory a thorough kicking. -Andy &lt;/p&gt;" />

  <h1>Thanks for giving a treasured childhood memory a thorough kicking</h1>

  <div>In 2001 I first saw the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope#Special_Edition">"Special Edition"</a> of Star Wars (aka <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope">Star Wars IV: A New Hope</a>)... I was not happy - here&#39;s the open-letter to George Lucas that I wrote as a review on IMDB. Given that he&#39;s now planning on <a href="http://www.starwars.com/movies/saga/announce3d/index.html">doing it all over again in 3D</a> I thought I&#39;d republish it - Mr Lucas - all this still applies ... please stop fucking about with my childhood.

<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding-left: 1ex;">Dear George,
<p />I remember seeing Star Wars on its first release and being completely immersed in the story, the characters, the effects - to a thirteen year old it was wonderful, I saw it a couple of times after and the magic never diminished.
<p />BUT THEN at the weekend I sat down and saw this "new" film with added effects that more often than not stuck out like a sore thumb. Additions that somehow said "remember that film you loved so much...well actually it wasn&#39;t good enough". Well Mr Lucas it WAS good enough, it didn&#39;t need some hokey special effects to make it better - for me it had the opposite effect.
<p />In particular the scene with Han and Jabba looked dreadful - it repeated (almost verbatim) a previous scene, made Jabba seem insignificant and unthreatening and made poor Harrison Ford look like a second-rate actor who didn&#39;t know where to look.
<p />Sure I still enjoyed the film - but the additions (and of course the inevitable subtractions) meant that there was no longer any magic here for me.
<p />Just because you can do this it doesn&#39;t mean you should. You had the opportunity to show off all your special effects muscle in The Phantom Menace, why did you feel the need to meddle with your "back-catalogue" to try and produce a homogeneous mass of work rather than a timeline through recent film history. Your attempts failed and now you have a half-decent film where there was once a great one.
