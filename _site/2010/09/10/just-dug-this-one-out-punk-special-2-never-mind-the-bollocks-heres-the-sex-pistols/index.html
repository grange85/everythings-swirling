<meta name="description" content="Never Mind The Bollocks, Here&#39;s the Sex PistolsI sort of wanted to not like this, I wanted to say how much better The Damned were and that they never really got the love/respect that the Pistols did. I loved it for a while and my copy is one of the more worn/battered LPs in my collection. But I was always bothered by how punk The Sex Pistols were - as if they were trying too hard. But it&#39;s a great album - a couple of duff tracks but the opening 30 seconds of Pretty Vacant is pretty much the best 30 seconds of punk ever... or at least the most iconic. &lt;/param&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;The Damned&#39;s first album was better... but only just. &lt;/p&gt;" />
