<meta name="description" content="Inflammable Material by Stiff Little Fingers Never got into SLF at the time - not too sure why. I remember seeing them at the Guildford Civic Hall but reckon that was early 80s rather than later 70s so I can&#39;t blame that rather disappointing gig for my negligence. And negligent it surely was because this is mostly a gem. Not as consistently good as The Damned, and not as scarily powerful as The Ruts - but a classic that I feel sad for having ignored. Love also that the fab Mayo Thompson produced it. &lt;/param&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;/embed&gt; &lt;/p&gt;" />
