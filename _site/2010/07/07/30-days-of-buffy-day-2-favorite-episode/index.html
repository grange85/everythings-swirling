  <h1>30 Days of Buffy: Day 2: Favorite Episode</h1>

  <div>Hazel rather smugly said that I&#39;d obviously choose Once More With Feeling because I have "a thing" for musicals, so on the ride in this morning I started thinking about how I could prove her wrong. I pondered Hush (obviously) and Doppelgangland (mostly for Willow being so cute pretending to be vamp willow - and vamp Willow being so evil and skanky... and kind of gay). I thought about Who Are You (but that would be wrong). I thought about The Wish, The Gift, Prophecy Girl and even Ted!
<p /> But you know what my favourite episode of Buffy is...
<p />Once More WIth Feeling - because it has (mostly) great songs... and is funny... and is (mostly) faultless...
