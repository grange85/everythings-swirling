<p /> Anyway - favourite quote it is then - of course <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2010/07/30/30-days-of-buffy-day-25/">Hazel&#39;s already picked a stack of good ones</a> and I&#39;m sure with some time and patience I could too - after all it&#39;s not as if there aren&#39;t plenty - the dialogue in Buffy is often beautiful and funny and sweet and smart so I&#39;ll choose one that&#39;s only one of those...
