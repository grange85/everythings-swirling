I thought it&#39;d be perfect - she&#39;d pick Tara/Willow obviously and leave me to ponder over Willow and Oz... but oh no - she had to go and pick both - and obv being a bit more of a Buffy afficianado than me she managed to pick all the sweet moments from both of them. Oz was great, and reading Hazel&#39;s appraisal of the romance only reaffirms my decision to choose him as my favourite male character.
