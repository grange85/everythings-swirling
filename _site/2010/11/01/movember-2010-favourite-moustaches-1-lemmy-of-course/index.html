<p>Lemmy and his face fungus... if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_and_Marriage">Sammy Cahn had been writing his song</a> in the 80s there certainly would have been a lyric about it in there. Incredibly, in a most bizarre turn of events <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/26412141@N05/2868005175/">Lemmy actually shaved it off</a> for a while in the 90s... thankfully he saw the light and fixed everything shortly afterwards.</p>
