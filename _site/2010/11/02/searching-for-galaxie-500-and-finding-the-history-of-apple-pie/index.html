  <h1>Searching for Galaxie 500 and finding The History of Apple Pie</h1>

  <p><a href="http://www.fishsticktheatre.com/TV/Community/community.html"><img src="https://cdn.grange85.co.uk/swirling/uploads/2010/11/Community2x06_0018-300x168.jpg" alt="Dean &amp; Britta" title="Community2x06_0018" class="size-medium wp-image-1085" /></a>
<p>I have searches set up in Google (and Flickr and YouTube and anywhere else things may turn up) for Galaxie 500 (and anything else <a href="http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk">AHFoW</a> related) - of course I get <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/karwik/4229870285/">cars turning up regularly</a> - and recently the wonderful <a href="http://www.greendalecommunitycollege.com/">Community</a> has been polluting my searches as <a href="http://www.greendalecommunitycollege.com/">Greendale Community College</a> has both a dean and a student called Britta.</p></p>
<p> I also get links to lots of bands that are compared to, or express a love for, <a href="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/wiki/Galaxie_500">Galaxie 500</a> (the band not the car) - this I don't mind... although the comparisons are often very, VERY wide of the mark - just because it's slower than mainstream indie rock doesn't mean it must be like Galaxie 500.</p></p>
<p>Anyway yesterday's find wasn't a comparison but a professed love of Galaxie 500 and Luna by the singer of London band <a href="http://thoap.tumblr.com/">The History of Apple Pie</a> (apparently Tug is a reference to Tugboat)... so off I duly went to their <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thehistoryofapplepie">MySpace page</a> and (thank heavens) a <a href="http://soundcloud.com/thehistoryofapplepie/">Soundcloud page</a> and gave them a listen and liked very much what I heard - see if you do...</p></p>
