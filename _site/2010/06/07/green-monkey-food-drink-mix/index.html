Hot Chocolate Boy - Beat HappeningLove Beat Happening and love chocolate (although not so much hot chocolate). Name drop: I got into Beat Happening when I borrowed a copy of Black Candy from Graham Linehan (of It Crowd and Twitter fame). Red Vines - Aimee Mann I actually didn&#39;t know Red Vines were food until quite recently - Hazel suggested this (and a few others in this list) as I was struggling to come up with ideas for a mix I thought would be a piece of cake. Cheese &amp; Onions - The RutlesIn a valiant effort to steer clear of the obvious I opted for The Rutles version of Cheese and Onions over the Galaxie 500 version. Neil Innes Rutles songs were so utterly convincing that it wasn&#39;t a surprise that the Galaxie 500 box set credited the song to Innes/Lennon/McCartney. Strawberry Fields Forever - The BeatlesAlthough nobody could have done The Beatles as perfectly as this. This is the peak of The Beatles genius - it was ALL downhill from the Strawberry Fields/Penny Lane single (and don&#39;t let anyone tell you different with their Sgt Pepper and Abbey Road nonsense!). Sprout and the Bean - Joanna NewsomJoanna Newsom is unique and makes stunning music - this is both unique and stunning and provides some much needed greens to the mix. Apples in the Trees - MirahFor a short while I was tempted to do a fruit only mix but this and the above strawberries where the only survivors. Ginger Snaps - Dean &amp; BrittaOK, so my valiant effort to steer clear of the obvious finally caved because I love ginger snaps and Ginger Snaps so it really couldn&#39;t not be in there. It&#39;s a song filled with wordplay. The Man Who Loved Beer - Lambchop And nice to finish with a beer. Love this song more than anything else that Kurt Wagner has done. &lt;/p&gt;" />
