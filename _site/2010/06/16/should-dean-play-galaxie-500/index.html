OK - here&#39;s a dissenting voice - although I&#39;ll qualify my defence by linking to my previous rant against Dean &amp; Britta covering Galaxie 500. This will be just a bunch of thoughts - a lot of which I won&#39;t explain the relevance of - partly because they may not have relevance... Dean has on a number of occasions mentioned how hard he finds it coming up with new songs/song ideas - I think it was (and I don&#39;t have copy of Black Postcards to hand to double check) one of the contributing factors to Galaxie 500 breaking up - the two Dean &amp; Britta albums and the 13 Most Beautiful soundtrack are all liberally sprinkled with covers - I think it&#39;s safe to assume that while he has consistently been producing great material it doesn&#39;t just fall out of him. Galaxie 500 are back on the radar now - the Domino and 20|20|20 reissues have seen to that. While reunions are de riguer we&#39;re all painfully aware (and in my case grateful) that a Galaxie 500 one is not on the cards I&#39;ve generally loved Luna covering Galaxie 500, and enjoyed Dean &amp; Britta&#39;s forays into that part of Dean&#39;s past (with the exception linked above) - also one of my high-points of 2010 (high oints of any year prob) was Damon &amp; Naomi covering Blue Thunder at The Luminaire - I don&#39;t mind, and actually genuinely love, that these songs can still work. 13 Most Beautiful - as a project - has eaten a chunk out of the &quot;write the next album&quot; time so clearly the next new album is not ready. The music industry is a different animal now - without record companies proffering huge advances to make albums the money is having to be made elsewhere... actually I wonder if this is the key point. Smaller bands/artists need to find new ways to make if they want music to be a career rather than a side project - and whether its advertising, soundtracks, reunions, or rehashing your back catalogue (or any/all of the above) - then that is what needs to be done. Galaxie 500 shows are going to make money - for some of the reasons mentioned above. I know that there will be new material from Dean (&amp; Britta) at some point in the future - and I can wait - it&#39;s not like there isn&#39;t stacks of other great music to listen to - and in the meantime I&#39;m happy to enjoy hearing (of) Galaxie 500 reunion shows knowing that they&#39;re not Galaxie 500 and it&#39;s not breaking anything by happening. I&#39;m a fan. Come ride the fiery breeze... &lt;/p&gt;" />

  <h1>Should Dean play Galaxie 500?</h1>

  <div>A discussion has struck up on the <a href="http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/mailing-list/">Galaxie 500 Mailing List</a> about whether Dean should be doing these "<a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com/blog/?p=668">...plays Galaxie 500 shows</a>" or getting on with new material - here&#39;s my defence of the Galaxie 500 shows (as posted to the list)...
<p />
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">OK - here&#39;s a dissenting voice - although I&#39;ll qualify my defence by linking to my <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2009/06/20/dean-britta-cover-snowstorm-a-sacrilegious-opinion/" target="_blank">previous rant against Dean &amp; Britta covering Galaxie 500</a>.
<p />This will be just a bunch of thoughts - a lot of which I won&#39;t explain the relevance of - partly because they may not have relevance...
<p />Dean has on a number of occasions mentioned how hard he finds it coming up with new songs/song ideas - I think it was (and I don&#39;t have copy of Black Postcards to hand to double check) one of the contributing factors to Galaxie 500 breaking up - the two Dean &amp; Britta albums and the 13 Most Beautiful soundtrack are all liberally sprinkled with covers - I think it&#39;s safe to assume that while he has consistently been producing great material it doesn&#39;t just fall out of him.
<p />Galaxie 500 are back on the radar now - the Domino and 20|20|20 reissues have seen to that.
<p />While reunions are de riguer we&#39;re all painfully aware (and in my case grateful) that a Galaxie 500 one is not on the cards
<p />I&#39;ve generally loved Luna covering Galaxie 500, and enjoyed Dean &amp; Britta&#39;s forays into that part of Dean&#39;s past (with the exception linked above) - also one of my high-points of 2010 (high oints of any year prob) was Damon &amp; Naomi covering Blue Thunder at The Luminaire - I don&#39;t mind, and actually genuinely love, that these songs can still work.
<p />13 Most Beautiful - as a project - has eaten a chunk out of the "write the next album" time so clearly the next new album is not ready.
<p />The music industry is a different animal now - without record companies proffering huge advances to make albums the money is having to be made elsewhere... actually I wonder if this is the key point. Smaller bands/artists need to find new ways to make if they want music to be a career rather than a side project - and whether its advertising, soundtracks, reunions, or rehashing your back catalogue (or any/all of the above) - then that is what needs to be done.
